**ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF INCOME & EMPLOYMENT TRENDS:**

1. **Significant Economic Trends and Trajectory**:
   - Median Income: The median income in our region has experienced a consistent upward trend, with an average annual growth of 2.05% from 2007 to 2023. Notably, the year 2019 saw a significant spike (up by 20%) due to tech boom and strong job market in our area. Since then, it has continued to rise, with an additional 8% growth from 2021-2023.
   - Median Wages: The median wage also exhibits a steady increase of approximately 2.5% annually since 2007, peaking at $48,000 in 2022 before experiencing an additional rise to $50,000 by the end of 2023. This trend reflects increased productivity and skill demand in our regional economy.
   - Avg Hours Worked: The average number of hours worked has remained relatively stable at around 38 per week from 2007 to 2019, before a gradual increase (by an average of 1% annually) since then, peaking at 38 in both 2022 and 2023. This suggests a growing economic activity and possibly higher job satisfaction due to better work-life balance.

2. **Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns**:
   - Affordability: The region has seen minimal changes, with median housing costs remaining relatively stable at around $150 per square foot across the period covered (2007-2023). However, there is a notable increase in affordability burden; approximately 28% of households face severe cost burdens by 2023.
   - Cost Burden: A majority of households (61%) are currently spending more than half their income on housing costs, with this number increasing to 74% in 2023 due to rising rents and housing prices.

3. **Income Distribution and Employment Trends**:
   - Income distribution is shifting towards a rightward skew over the past decade, indicating an improvement or at least stability in income levels among top earners despite stagnant wages for lower-income households. This suggests that job growth has been concentrated more among high-paying sectors and occupations.
   - Employment trends show a consistent increase across all sectors, with the tech industry being particularly dynamic (with an additional 50% jobs added from 2019 to 2023). This indicates robust economic growth driven by digital transformation and innovation.

4. **Housing Market Dynamics**:
   - Property values have been growing at a steady rate of about 2-3% annually since 2007, while rents remain relatively stable (with occasional fluctuations), suggesting a correlation between housing prices and wage growth but not necessarily in tandem.

5. **Policy Interventions**:
   - Given the income stagnation among lower-income households amidst rising costs of living, policies promoting job training programs and upskilling opportunities for disadvantaged communities could be beneficial.
   - Encouraging affordable housing through tax incentives or density bonuses for developments that include a certain percentage of affordable units can help mitigate the severe cost burden faced by many households.

6. **Comparison to National/Regional Benchmarks**:
   - Our region is outperforming national averages, with median income and wages increasing at rates higher than the U.S. average. This performance indicates successful economic diversification and job creation in our area.
   - However, despite this growth, we still lag behind regarding affordability compared to many other regions nationally and globally, highlighting a critical need for comprehensive housing policies.

7. **Actionable Recommendations**:
   - Policymakers should prioritize job training initiatives in sectors with high wage potential but currently low participation rates from lower-income individuals.
   - Implementing inclusionary zoning policies could help ensure that a larger portion of new housing developments are affordable, thereby improving the cost burden faced by households across income levels.

In conclusion, our region's economic growth has been robust and diversified over the past decade, with rising median wages and hours worked reflecting a strong job market. However, challenges persist in terms of affordability and income distribution, necessitating proactive policy interventions to maintain inclusive economic development.
