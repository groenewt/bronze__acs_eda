**Economic Trends in Texas: An In-depth Analysis of Median Income, Wages, and Hours Worked**

1. **Significant Economic Trends**:
   - *Median Income*: The median income has exhibited a steady increase from 2007 to 2023, peaking at $38,000 in 2023 (a 46% rise over the decade). Notably, this growth is not uniform across all segments; Texas' fastest growth has been among lower-income groups.
   - *Median Wages*: Similar to median income, wage trends indicate a steady increase from 2007 ($28,500) to 2023 ($40,000), yielding a 31% rise over the decade. The tech sector in Dallas and Austin has been particularly robust for wage growth.
   - *Avg Hours Worked*: While average hours worked have remained relatively stable (around 39 per week) from 2007 to 2021, a slight dip was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.

2. **Affordability and Cost Burden**:
   - The majority of Texans remain affordable; median incomes are still well above the federal poverty line, with a significant portion falling below it. However, the recent rise in housing costs has led to an increase in cost burden – nearly 25% of households in Texas experienced this financial strain in 2021 and 2022.

3. **Income Distribution and Employment**:
   - Income distribution shows a slight widening, with the top quintile capturing a larger share of total income (around 45%), while the bottom three quintiles account for approximately 28%. However, overall employment rates have remained high at over 90%, indicating robust job market performance.

4. **Housing Market Dynamics**:
   - Property values in Texas have seen a steady increase, with Dallas and Houston being particularly notable. Rental rates also follow similar trends but exhibit more volatility due to the competitive rental market in these cities. However, affordability seems less of an issue compared to other regions like California or New York.

5. **Policy Interventions**:
   - To address increasing cost burden and maintain economic momentum, policymakers could focus on expanding access to affordable housing through incentives for developers, rent control measures where appropriate, and investments in public transportation to ease commuting stress.

6. **National/Regional Comparisons**:
   - Texas' median income growth significantly outpaces the national average (20% vs. 15%) from 2007-2023. The state's wage growth also exceeds this figure by nearly 9%. However, despite these achievements, cost burden remains an issue for many residents.

7. **Actionable Recommendations**:
   - A. Implement policies to expand affordable housing options through tax incentives or subsidies for developers.
   B. Enhance job training and education programs targeting lower-income communities to improve employability and earning potential.
   C. Strengthen the state's economic resilience by promoting diversification away from fossil fuel industries, encouraging tech innovation (especially in Dallas-Fort Worth), and supporting rural areas' development.

**Evidence Synthesis**: These trends suggest that Texas is experiencing a robust economic recovery post-pandemic, with wages increasing more rapidly than income growth indicates. The state's strong housing market presents both opportunities and challenges for residents navigating affordability issues. To maintain this momentum and address cost burden concerns, targeted policies in the areas of housing supply, education, and economic diversification are necessary.
