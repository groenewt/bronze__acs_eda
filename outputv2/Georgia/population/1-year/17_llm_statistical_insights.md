1. Mean vs Median: The mean, which is a measure of central tendency calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations, generally reflects skewed distributions better than median (the middle value in an ordered list). In many cases, particularly for right-skewed data, the mean will be higher than the median. For instance, when comparing 'Income_Per_Hour' to its median, we observe that 790619 observations have an income per hour lower than $26 (mean), compared to only 19 with a figure below the median of $16.83, suggesting skewness and potentially unusual high or low earnings in this dataset.

2. SKEWNESS values: Skewness ranges from -1 to 1, where positive skewness indicates a right-skewed distribution (mean > median), negative skewness represents left-skewness (mean < median), and zero signifies a perfectly symmetric distribution. The high positive skewness for 'Income_Per_Hour' suggests that the mean is indeed greater than the median, indicating a stronger influence of higher earners in this data set compared to lower earners.

3. KURTOSIS: This measure indicates whether extreme values are more or less frequent than expected by chance (in a normal distribution). A kurtosis value of 0 suggests a mesokurtic distribution, which is similar to that of a normal distribution. Excess kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution—a positive excess kurtosis implies fatter tails or outliers in the data compared to a normal distribution, while a negative excess kurtosis indicates thinner tails. The high positive excess kurtosis (KURTOSIS = 7330.343 for 'Income_Per_Hour') suggests that this variable has heavy tails with a higher frequency of extreme values than would be expected in a normal distribution, indicating potential outliers and unusual earnings patterns.

4. VARIANCE/STD DEV: High variance or standard deviation (both measures of dispersion) indicate high variability in the data, i.e., wide spread between the lowest and highest values. For 'Income_Per_Hour' with a variance of 2973.11, this suggests that there is considerable income variation among hourly earners in our dataset - some can earn thousands while others barely reach hundreds. This high dispersion might be due to the skewed nature of this variable (as discussed earlier).

5. Key Insights:
   a) The distribution of 'Income_Per_Hour' is strongly right-skewed, indicating an unusually high number of individuals earning significantly more than others in terms of hourly wages. This could imply that while there are many lower earners, the highest earners significantly contribute to the mean income, possibly due to a smaller pool of highly paid workers or outliers with very large salaries.
   
   b) The presence of high negative skewness and excess kurtosis in 'Income_Per_Hour' suggests that this variable is heavily influenced by extreme values (outliers), which are not accounted for well by the mean alone, implying a need to use robust statistical measures or consider these outliers while interpreting results.
   
   c) The wide variation and skewness in income per hour distribution highlight disparities in earnings across different segments of the population, underscoring the importance of considering potential biases or inequalities when making conclusions based on this data.
