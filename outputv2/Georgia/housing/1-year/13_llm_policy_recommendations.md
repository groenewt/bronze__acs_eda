1. **High-Impact Research Questions**:

   a) **Question 1: How has the income distribution evolved in Georgia from 2007 to 2023, and what are the implications for poverty reduction policies?**
   - *Key Variables*: Income_to_FPL_Ratio, Median_Household_Income, Poverty_Rate (modified by income threshold).
   - *Analytical Methods*: Regression analysis, concentration curve/income share distribution plots.
   - *Expected Policy Implications*: Identifying income thresholds for poverty reduction programs and assessing the effectiveness of targeted interventions in different socioeconomic segments.

   b) **Question 2: What are the trends in housing affordability (as indicated by Annual_Rent_to_Value_Ratio) across various demographic groups in Georgia from 2007 to 2023, and how do they correlate with employment opportunities?**
   - *Key Variables*: Annual_Rent_to_Value_Ratio.
   - *Analytical Methods*: Spatial regression analysis, cluster analysis on housing affordability indices.
   - *Expected Policy Implications*: Tailored housing policies to address disparities in access and affordability across demographic groups, linking them with labor market trends for targeted interventions.

   c) **Question 3: How have changes in the workforce composition (e.g., growth of high-skill sectors like aerospace/defense or technology), correlated with economic indicators such as GDP and employment rates, between 2015 and 2023?**
   - *Key Variables*: Employment status, Flag_Workers_Per_Person, Industry_Code.
   - *Analytical Methods*: Time-series analysis of labor force participation rates by sector, spatial panel data regression.
   - *Expected Policy Implications*: Strategic planning for workforce development and skills training to align with high-growth sectors' needs, informing future education policies.

2. **Longitudinal Analyses**: The temporal coverage enables researchers to track changes in various socioeconomic indicators over time, identify cyclical patterns (e.g., economic downturns or expansions), and observe the impact of policy interventions on these trends. For instance, it can reveal whether specific tax cuts or stimulus packages have had a lasting effect on income distribution or employment rates.

3. **Cross-Sectional Comparisons**: Comparing Georgia with its peer states (North Carolina, Texas, Florida) and national benchmarks in economic indicators such as GDP growth rate, unemployment levels, and median household income can provide a broader perspective on the state's performance relative to other jurisdictions.

4. **Visualizations**:
   - **Scatter Plots**: To visualize correlations between different variables (e.g., relationship between education attainment and employment rates).
   - **Heat Maps**: To illustrate regional disparities in housing affordability or income distribution across the state.
   - **Line Graphs**: For tracking changes over time in specific indicators, such as poverty rates or employment growth rates.

5. **Methodological Challenges & Limitations**: Researchers should address potential biases arising from sampling variability and response rate decline since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on data collection methods. Additionally, they must account for potential underreporting of certain demographic groups or occupational categories in the census data. Lastly, ensuring accurate coding and interpretation of geopolitical boundaries used in PUMAs is crucial to avoid misinterpretation of spatial analyses.
