# model: granite3.1-moe:3b-instruct-fp16, Engine: ROCm llama.cpp, GPU: AMD RX 9060 XT -- AI-Generated Insights: Policy Recommendations

**1. Research Questions:**

**RQ1: Analyzing the Impact of Housing Affordability on Economic Mobility and Social Well-being in Utah from 2007 to 2023.**
   - Key Variables: Annual_Rent_to_Value_Ratio, Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost, Property_Tax_Rate, Income_to_FPL_Ratio.
   - Analytical Methods: Regression analysis to understand the relationship between housing affordability (dependent variable) and economic mobility indicators (independent variables).
   - Policy Implications: Informing state-specific policies aimed at stabilizing property values, promoting energy efficiency, and reducing tax burdens on low-income households.

**RQ2: Assessing the Effect of Industrial Policies on Employment Trends in Technology Sectors from 2017 to 2023.**
   - Key Variables: Income_Adjustment_Factor, Occupancy_Rates, Industry/Occupation, Economic_Intensity.
   - Analytical Methods: Time-series analysis and regression modeling considering the temporal shift in industrial policies to understand their influence on employment trends within specific sectors (technology).
   - Policy Implications: Developing targeted policy interventions aimed at fostering industry growth or retraining programs for displaced workers.

**RQ3: Examining Demographic Shifts and Their Economic and Social Consequences in Utah's Silicon Slopes from 2011 to 2023.**
   - Key Variables: Age_Distribution, Births, Migration, STEM_Education.
   - Analytical Methods: Spatial autocorrelation analysis and demographic transition modeling to understand the impact of population dynamics on economic growth and social cohesion in Silicon Slopes.
   - Policy Implications: Implementing targeted regional development policies that promote diversification from tech-centric industries, ensuring equitable distribution of benefits across different age groups and communities.

**2. Longitudinal Analyses:** The dataset's temporal coverage (16 years) allows researchers to track long-term trends in housing affordability, employment patterns, and demographic shifts. This enables comprehensive examination of the effects of economic downturns, recovery strategies, technological advancements, or policy changes over time.

**3. Cross-sectional Comparisons:** Comparing Utah's data with peer states (e.g., Colorado, Idaho, Washington) on similar key variables will provide valuable insights into how state-specific factors influence economic and demographic outcomes. This can also inform policy comparisons and identify best practices for other jurisdictions aiming to boost their Silicon Slopes or similar tech hubs.

**4. Visualizations:** 
   - **Line Graph: Rent/Income Ratio Over Time** – To visualize the trend in housing affordability against income levels over the 16-year period.
   - **Heat Map: Occupancy Rate by Industry Sector** – Illustrating how different sectors' employment patterns have shifted over time, informing workforce development strategies.
   - **Bubble Plot: Demographic Distribution by Age Group and Region** – Demonstrating the age structure of Utah's population across regions, which can guide tailored regional development policies.

**5. Methodological Challenges & Limitations:** 
   - **Data Quality**: The dataset might be affected by sampling biases or under-representation of certain demographic groups in specific years.
   - **Temporal Resolution**: While having 16 years' worth of data, the annual resolution may not capture rapid short-term trends effectively.
   - **Variable Interdependencies**: Some variables might have multicollinearity issues due to their interrelated nature (e.g., employment and industry growth), requiring careful preprocessing or advanced statistical techniques.

By addressing these research questions, conducting robust analyses, and leveraging the dataset's temporal coverage effectively, we can derive critical insights on Utah’s economic trajectory and social well-being from 2007 to 2023, informing evidence-based policy recommendations for fostering sustainable growth in its Silicon Slopes.
