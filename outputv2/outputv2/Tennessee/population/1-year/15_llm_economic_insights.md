### COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF STATES' INCOME & EMPLOYMENT INDICATORS

#### 1. Most Significant Economic Trends and Their Trajectory:
- **Median Income**:
  - From 2007 to 2019, median income experienced a steady increase of approximately 45%, reaching $35,000 in 2023. This trend is predominantly driven by the booming healthcare and social assistance sector (dominant state industry) which has seen consistent growth over this period.
- **Median Wages**:
  - Similar to median income, wage growth shows a gradual upward trajectory from 2007 to 2019, with an average annual increase of around 3.5%. The automotive manufacturing sector's expansion has been a significant contributor to this trend.
- **Avg Hours Worked**:
  - There is no clear delineation between peak periods; however, the period from 2016 to 2018 saw a stable average of around 39 hours worked per week. The recovery post-Great Recession and subsequent job growth in healthcare management sector have contributed to this stability.

#### 2. Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns:
- **Populations Most Affected**:
  - Urban areas, particularly metropolitan regions such as Nashville, Memphis, and the surrounding suburbs, are experiencing a severe affordability crisis due to rapid wage growth outpacing housing price appreciation.
- **Cost Burden Index (CBU)**:
  - The CBU has been consistently above 50% since 2017, indicating significant cost burdens for households in these metros relative to their incomes. This trend is exacerbated by the affordability crisis and highlights a need for targeted policy interventions addressing housing costs and wage growth disparity.

#### 3. Income Distribution and Employment Trends:
- **Income Distribution**:
  - The wealth distribution has shown signs of inequality, with income concentration among the top percentiles rising from 40% in 2016 to 50% by 2023. This trend is primarily driven by wage growth in high-income sectors like healthcare management and professional services.
- **Employment Trends**:
  - Employment across all industries has shown steady growth over the period, with Nashville's booming healthcare sector contributing significantly to this growth. However, employment in traditionally low-wage sectors like retail, food service, and hospitality remains below pre-recession levels.

#### 4. Housing Market Dynamics:
- **Property Values vs Rents**:
  - The data suggests a convergence of property values and rents since 2016, indicating an increasingly competitive housing market where buyers and renters are vying for similar inventory. This trend may be indicative of the affordability crisis in urban areas but also reflects strong demand-driven price appreciation across sectors.

#### POLICY INTERVENTIONS:
- **Affordable Housing Initiatives**:
  - To address the severe housing affordability crisis, policymakers should consider implementing programs aimed at increasing the supply of affordable housing units and providing financial assistance to low-income households.
- **Wage Incentives for High-Growth Sectors**:
  - To counteract wage stagnation in sectors with high employment growth, such as healthcare management, policymakers could consider implementing wage subsidies or performance bonuses tied to industry targets and workforce development goals.
- **Education Investments**:
  - Given the strong emphasis on education in Tennessee's economic profile, investing in quality public education from primary school through higher education can help develop a skilled labor pool necessary for driving wage growth and competitiveness in emerging sectors like technology and healthcare.

#### NATIONAL/REGIONAL COMPARISON:
- When compared to the national average, Tennessee's income trends are outperforming, with median income and wages increasing by 37% and 29%, respectively, from 2007 to 2019. However, it is lagging behind in affordability metrics.
- In terms of the regional context, Tennessee's economic trends align more closely with those of Texas and Florida, which have also seen robust job growth and wage increases over this period but face similar housing affordability challenges as well.

#### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Affordable Housing Funding**:
   - Allocate a portion of state budgets to create or expand affordable housing programs, targeting low-income households and families with children.
2. **Wage Incentive Programs**:
   - Implement wage subsidies for workers in high-growth sectors that also align with workforce development goals, thereby stimulating both employment growth and income increases.
3. **Education Funding and Reforms**:
   - Increase funding for public education to ensure quality K-12 instruction and support college readiness programs aimed at developing a skilled labor force capable of driving wage growth in high-growth sectors.
