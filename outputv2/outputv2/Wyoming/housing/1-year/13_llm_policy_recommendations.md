# model: granite3.1-moe:3b-instruct-fp16, Engine: ROCm llama.cpp, GPU: AMD RX 9060 XT -- AI-Generated Insights: Policy Recommendations

1. **High-Impact Research Questions:**

   a) *Question 1: How has the economic resilience of Wyoming's population evolved over time, particularly in relation to energy sector performance and pandemic recovery?*

      - Key Variables: Median household income, GDP per capita, employment status (energy-related vs. diversified), poverty rates
      - Analytical Methods: Time-series regression analysis, panel data techniques like Fixed Effects or Random Effects models to control for time-invariant factors.
      - Policy Implications: Inform targeted economic development strategies focusing on energy sector resilience and diversification efforts to mitigate future shocks.

   b) *Question 2: What are the long-term demographic trends in Wyoming, with particular attention to migration patterns, population aging, and educational attainment?*

      - Key Variables: Age distribution, sex ratio, household size, net migration rate, education level (high school graduate vs. bachelor's or higher), unemployment rates by sector
      - Analytical Methods: Segmented regression analysis to identify trends in specific demographic groups and their interplay with economic indicators.
      - Policy Implications: Tailored policies for attracting skilled labor, addressing educational disparities, and promoting regional migration patterns that align with state's development goals.

   c) *Question 3: How have housing characteristics evolved in Wyoming since the energy boom-bust cycles? Specifically, what are the long-term effects on affordability, particularly in areas like Jackson Hole and rural communities?*

      - Key Variables: Median home price, property tax rate, median annual rent to value ratio, affordability score (based on above variables), housing units by structure type
      - Analytical Methods: Spatial econometric techniques such as spatial lag or difference models to account for regional differences and identify local impacts.
      - Policy Implications: Policies aimed at improving housing affordability, promoting diversified economic bases in rural areas, and leveraging Wyoming's unique geographical features (like Yellowstone National Park) for tourism development.

2. **Methodological Considerations:**

   - The dataset's temporal coverage allows for the analysis of changes over time within a specific context, enabling more robust policy recommendations than static comparisons.
   - Longitudinal analyses can uncover trends in the dynamic economic and demographic landscapes of Wyoming, providing insights into state-specific resilience strategies.

3. **Cross-Sectional Comparisons:**

   - Analyzing changes in GDP per capita against employment rates across different industries (mining, tourism) can reveal the economic diversification efforts' effectiveness.
   - Comparison of housing affordability indices between urban and rural Wyoming can highlight regional disparities that inform targeted policy interventions.

4. **Visualizations:**

   a) *Scatter plots to illustrate the relationship between household income and other variables such as property value or employment status.*
   b) *Choropleth maps highlighting changes in demographic characteristics (like age distribution) across different PUMAs within Wyoming over time.*
   c) *Dynamic line graphs depicting the evolution of economic indicators, like GDP growth and unemployment rates, from 2007 to 2023.*

5. **Methodological Challenges/Limitations:**

   - The dataset's focus on aggregated PUMAs might obscure micro-level trends specific to individual communities or industries within Wyoming.
   - The analysis of longitudinal data requires careful handling of potential time series biases, ensuring proper adjustment for cyclical patterns in income and employment data.

By addressing these research questions, methodological considerations, cross-sectional comparisons, visualizations, and challenges, policymakers can gain a nuanced understanding of Wyoming's economic and demographic trajectory over the past 16 years, informing targeted strategies for sustainable development.
