1. **High-Impact Research Questions:**

   a) **Rising Inequality and Stagnant Wages: Analyzing the Evolution of Income Disparities in Wyoming (2007-2023):**
      - Key Variables: Total_Annual_Income, Median_Household_Income, Gini_Coefficient, Wealth_Distribution
      - Analytical Methods: Regression analysis to identify trends and correlations with demographic factors. Disaggregate data by race/ethnicity for a nuanced understanding of inequality impacts.
      - Expected Policy Implications: Targeted policies addressing wage gaps, promoting equal access to higher education and skill development, and supporting social safety nets for lower-income residents.

   b) **Energy Sector's Economic Resilience Post-Boom and Bust Cycles (2011-2023):**
      - Key Variables: Flag_Interest_Dividend_Income, Total_Annual_Hours, Industry_Sector_2007, Occupation_Skill_Level_2010, STEM_Category, Is_STEM, Is_STEM_Related
      - Analytical Methods: Time-series analysis to track changes in employment patterns and income levels. Clustering algorithms can be used to identify distinct subsectors within the energy sector that contribute differently to the state's economy.
      - Expected Policy Implications: Diversification strategies for energy, including support for renewable energy initiatives and investments in infrastructure resilience post-bust cycles.

   c) **Affordability and Displacement Trends in Wyoming Housing Markets (2007-2023):**
      - Key Variables: Median_Home_Value, Affordability_Index, Home_Values_Yearly_Change, Occupancy_Rates, Tenure_Distribution, Location_Factors
      - Analytical Methods: Spatial analysis to map changes in housing affordability and demographic shifts. Longitudinal regression models can be used to assess the impact of economic factors on home prices and rental costs.
      - Expected Policy Implications: Inclusionary zoning policies, rent control measures, and initiatives promoting sustainable urban development to ensure housing affordability for low-income residents.

2. **Longitudinal Analyses:**
   The 16-year temporal coverage of the dataset enables comprehensive examination of trends in income distribution, employment patterns, and economic diversification over time. This analysis can reveal whether the state's energy sector has become more stable post-boom/bust cycles or if there are emerging sectors to support long-term growth.

3. **Cross-Sectional Comparisons:**
   Comparing Wyoming with peer states like Montana, Alaska, and North Dakota can provide insights into how a state's economic profile affects demographic trends, housing affordability, and income distribution differently from other resource-dependent states.

4. **Visualizations:**
   - A stacked bar chart to illustrate the distribution of industries over time, highlighting shifts due to boom/bust cycles or economic transitions.
   - An interactive map displaying changes in median home values and occupancy rates across different geographical regions within Wyoming.
   - A line graph showing the trends in income disparities (e.g., Gini coefficient) over time, aiding in understanding the evolution of wealth distribution.

5. **Methodological Challenges and Limitations:**
   Researchers should be aware that the dataset's cross-sectional nature may limit the study of causal relationships between variables. Longitudinal designs coupled with sophisticated panel data models would provide stronger evidence for causality in such analyses. Additionally, the rural composition and sparse population distribution pose challenges to generalizing findings across broader geographical contexts.

By addressing these research recommendations, scholars can contribute meaningful insights into Wyoming's economic trajectory, inform policymaking, and enhance our understanding of state-specific labor market dynamics and housing affordability issues.
