1. MEAN vs MEDIAN: For each variable, the mean (average) often provides a more comprehensive view of central tendency due to its sensitivity to outliers or extreme values. The median, on the other hand, is less affected by these extreme points and presents a better representation of the typical value in a dataset without them. Comparing means and medians can reveal potential skewness:
   - In cases where mean > median (like income), it often indicates that there are outliers or higher-than-average values pulling the average upwards, which may suggest an unusual distribution favoring extremes rather than typical values. For instance, in a salary dataset, this could imply a significant number of high earners skewing the mean upward from the median wage.
   - Conversely, if mean < median (like property value), it suggests that most data points are closer to the middle of the range and fewer values are at either extreme, indicating a more symmetric distribution around the center.

2. SKEWNESS: This measures the asymmetry or skewness of a distribution. Negative skewness indicates a left-skewed (tail on the left), while positive skewness denotes a right-skewed (tail on the right) distribution. High absolute values (> 1) indicate significant skew, implying that the tail end of the data has considerably more influence than the middle or beginning. For example, in credit card spending data, high negative skewness could suggest an overabundance of low-value transactions along with fewer high-value ones, indicating a leftward skew.

3. KURTOSIS: This measures the "tailedness" or heaviness of the tails in a distribution compared to a normal distribution. Values greater than 0 (positive kurtosis) indicate heavier tails and more peakedness (outliers), whereas values less than 0 denote lighter-tailed distributions with fewer outliers. High positive kurtosis suggests that data has heavy tails, indicating potential for extreme events or outliers; negative kurtosis indicates a "platykurtic" distribution which is flatter and more common in datasets where most outcomes are near the mean.

4. VARIANCE/STD DEV: These measures of dispersion indicate how spread out data points are from the mean. Higher values imply greater variability or dispersion, while lower values suggest tightness around the central tendency. Variables showing high dispersion include income and property value, suggesting that these datasets have a wide range of possible outcomes. For instance, in an income dataset, extreme wage earners could significantly inflate the mean compared to the median, leading to higher variance/standard deviation.

5. Key insights:
   - The data exhibits significant variability and dispersion across all variables. This suggests that many factors contribute to these datasets and there's a wide range of possible outcomes for each variable.
   - Many variables show skewness or heavy tails, indicating the presence of extreme values or outliers which could significantly influence central tendencies (means). For example, property value has considerable right-skewness suggesting the potential existence of high-value properties that drastically inflate the mean compared to the median.
   - Some variables like income and water cost show relatively low dispersion, indicating a more normal distribution with most data points clustering around central tendencies. However, even in these cases, there's still considerable variation, reflecting diverse earnings or water usage across individuals or households.
