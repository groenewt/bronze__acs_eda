## STRATEGIC RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Research Question: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected income disparities across different demographic groups in West Virginia?

**Key Variables to Analyze:**
  - Income_to_FPL_Ratio (to assess income relative to federal poverty level)
  - Income_Adjustment_Factor (to adjust for inflation and cost of living)
  - Gross_Rent, Rent_Amount_Monthly, Annual_Rent_to_Value_Ratio (to analyze housing affordability trends)

**Appropriate Analytical Methods:**
  - Time-series analysis to track changes in income disparities over the pandemic period.
  - Regression models with control for demographic characteristics to isolate the impact of COVID-19 on different groups.
  - Disaggregating data by age, race/ethnicity, and gender to identify specific subgroups affected.

**Expected Policy Implications:**
  - Targeted policies to mitigate economic hardships among vulnerable populations (e.g., unemployment benefits adjustments).
  - Affordable housing initiatives tailored to high-poverty areas where income disparities are most pronounced.

### 2. Research Question: What is the relationship between structural age and economic growth in West Virginia?

**Key Variables to Analyze:**
  - Structure_Age, Structure_Age_Score (to assess aging infrastructure)
  - Working_Age_Persons (to gauge labor force participation)

**Appropriate Analytical Methods:**
  - Correlation analysis to understand the relationship between age structure and economic growth.
  - Spatial regression models incorporating geographical factors like urbanization rates, natural resource concentrations, etc., to provide a more comprehensive understanding of structural age's impact on economic performance.

**Expected Policy Implications:**
  - Investment in youth-oriented infrastructure projects (schools, healthcare facilities) and regional development initiatives focused on attracting younger demographics.

### 3. Research Question: How has the shift from coal to natural gas extraction impacted West Virginia's economy over time?

**Key Variables to Analyze:**
  - GDP, Employment_Status (coal and non-coal sectors), Industry/Occupation, Flag_Meals_Included_Rent (to assess housing affordability)

**Appropriate Analytical Methods:**
  - Time-series analysis comparing economic indicators during coal-dominated periods with those during the natural gas boom years.
  - Segmented regression models to identify distinct phases in the transition and their impact on employment, income distribution, and housing conditions.

**Expected Policy Implications:**
  - Strategic investments in infrastructure supporting a diversified economy (e.g., renewable energy sectors).
  - Policies that promote workforce development to facilitate transitions for coal industry workers into new industries.

### Longitudinal Analyses:
The extensive temporal coverage allows researchers to examine trends in income disparities, housing affordability, and economic growth over time, potentially uncovering structural shifts or long-term impacts of policy changes. Cross-sectional comparisons can be drawn between different years to identify cyclical patterns, seasonality effects, or rapidly changing dynamics within the state's demographic structure.

### Cross-Sectional Comparisons:
Comparing West Virginia with neighboring states (e.g., Ohio and Pennsylvania) that have similar geographical features could provide valuable insights into regional economic and social disparities, as well as the impact of common factors like natural resource extraction and infrastructure development on local economies.

### Visualizations:
1. **Stacked Area Charts:** To visualize income distribution trends over time or structural age progression.
2. **Heatmap:** For displaying correlation coefficients between aging indicators (structure_age) and various socioeconomic factors, highlighting geographical hotspots of concern.
3. **Line Graphs:** Depicting the evolution of employment in different industries and occupations during the transition from coal to natural gas extraction.

### Methodological Challenges:
- Ensuring data quality and consistency across multiple years to avoid biases or measurement errors.
- Managing the complexity of integrating various demographic, economic, and housing variables into comprehensive analytical frameworks without oversimplification.
- Addressing potential confounding factors (e.g., changes in state policies, national economic trends) that might influence the observed relationships.
