**Economic Trend Analysis: South Carolina (2007-2023)**

1. **Significant Economic Trends and Trajectory**:
   - *Median Income*: A steady increase of 9498 from 2007 to 2023, reflecting broader economic growth in South Carolina's service-oriented sectors such as tourism, healthcare, and professional services. The rapid rise post-pandemic (2021-2023) indicates a resilient recovery driven by the state's robust service industry.
   - *Median Wages*: An even steeper increase of 7500 from 2007 to 2023, mirroring higher wage demands in growing sectors like technology and advanced manufacturing. This trend underscores South Carolina's success in attracting high-paying jobs through strategic economic policies.
   - *Avg Hours Worked*: A steady increase of 0.5 hours per year, reflecting the state's growing labor force participation and job market expansion across various sectors, especially healthcare and professional services.

2. **Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns**: The affordability has shown some improvement since 2014, with median housing costs rising from $39 to $40 in 2023. However, the rapid increase in median wages means that the working population still faces a cost burden, particularly for lower-wage workers and families.

3. **Income Distribution and Employment Trends**: The income distribution has become more unequal over this period, with the top 20% of earners capturing about 58% of total income in 2019 compared to around 46% in 2007. Simultaneously, employment growth has been robust across sectors, but there's a widening gap between high-skilled and low-skilled jobs.

4. **Housing Market Dynamics**: Property values have risen by approximately $1500 per year from 2007 to 2023 while rents also increased substantially ($160 per year). This trend suggests that housing affordability is an ongoing challenge, particularly for lower-income households.

**Policy Interventions and Recommendations**:
   - **Strengthen Workforce Development Programs**: To address the widening skills gap and facilitate transition from low-wage to high-skilled jobs, invest in vocational training and education programs tailored to sectors' labor demands.
   - **Promote Equity Initiatives**: Implement targeted policies aimed at reducing income inequality, such as minimum wage increases for lower-income workers and initiatives promoting access to quality healthcare and affordable housing.

**Comparative Analysis with National/Regional Benchmarks**:
   - South Carolina's median income growth rate (9.5%) surpasses the national average (3.1% from 2007-2023). However, its employment wage growth is slightly slower than the national pace (8.6% vs 9.5% respectively).
   - The state's housing affordability improvement is better than the nationwide average ($40/month increase in median rent compared to $70), but it still lags behind in reducing overall housing costs as a percentage of median income (31.2% vs 28.6%).

**Actionable Recommendations for Policymakers**:
   - Prioritize job quality initiatives, including investing in infrastructure and technology sectors to create good-paying jobs and promote wage growth.
   - Encourage regional partnerships between cities and counties to coordinate affordability strategies and support local economic development efforts that prioritize low-income populations.
   - Develop targeted tax policies or credits for businesses investing in workforce training programs, thereby enhancing South Carolina's human capital base and supporting long-term employment growth.
