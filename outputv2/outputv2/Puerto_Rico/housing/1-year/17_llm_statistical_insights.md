1. **MEAN vs MEDIAN:** The mean, which is a measure of central tendency that considers all data points equally, can be skewed by extreme values or outliers. In contrast, the median, which represents the middle value when data is ordered from least to greatest, is more robust against these influences. For instance, in income data (FLAG_First_Mortgage_Payment), the mean suggests a higher average monthly mortgage payment than what's reflected by the median. This might indicate that while some households have substantial first mortgages, many others carry very little or no debt, skewing the mean downward. 

2. **SKEWNESS values:** SKEWNESS measures the degree of asymmetry in a distribution around its mean. A positive value for skewness suggests a right-skewed (or positively skewed) distribution - data values are concentrated on the left side of the graph and extend farther to the right, with an outlier or tail extending upwards. Conversely, a negative skewness implies a left-skewed distribution - data tends to be more spread out on the right side of the plot than the left. For example, Flag_Gross_Rent has a high positive skewness value indicating a significant proportion of households make minimal or no gross mortgage payments, skewing the mean upwards and causing a right-skewed distribution around it.

3. **KURTOSIS:** Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the probability distribution - heavy tails indicate higher risk or outliers compared to a normal (bell-shaped) distribution. Values greater than three represent leptokurtic distributions with heavier tails and more frequent extreme values, while values less than three denote platykurtic distributions that are lighter-tailed and have fewer extreme values. For instance, Flag_Property_Value has a high positive kurtosis value (14.734), indicating a higher risk of extremely high or low property values compared to what would be expected in a normal distribution.

4. **VARIANCE/STD DEV:** Variance is the square of standard deviation and measures how spread out data points are from their mean. A high variance suggests that data points vary significantly, often leading to wide ranges between individuals' scores or observations. The high dispersion seen in Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost (15,102.82) indicates substantial variability in utility expenses across different households. This could be due to differences in the size of homes, energy consumption habits, and local utility costs.

**Key Insights:**

- **Data Homogeneity:** Most variables show a clear pattern between their mean and median values, suggesting homogeneous data distribution around these measures. However, Flag_First_Mortgage_Payment stands out with its high mean compared to the median due to a disproportionately large number of households carrying minimal or no first mortgages.

- **Outliers and Skewness:** High skewness values in variables like Flag_Gross_Rent and Income_to_FPL_Ratio indicate potential presence of outliers, which can skew the mean and highlight significant differences between median and mean. This could suggest that while many households are similarly affected by financial conditions (e.g., income), some experience substantial first mortgage payments or have higher utility bills than others.

- **Extreme Values:** The high variance in Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost highlights the potential for significant variability in these expenses among different households, suggesting a need to consider strategies to manage and potentially reduce such costs across the population.
