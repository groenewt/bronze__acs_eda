TEMPORAL COVERAGE:
The dataset spans from 2007 to 2023, with a missing year of 2020 due to the pandemic's disruptions in data collection. This gap might introduce sampling biases or incomplete trends for that specific period. Researchers should be cautious about extrapolating data from years before and after 2020 when analyzing broader patterns, particularly as lockdowns and unemployment spikes affected economic activities across the nation.

SAMPLE SIZE TRENDS:
The growth rate of approximately 26.5% per year indicates a steady increase in sample size over time. This trend suggests that the Census Bureau has maintained consistent efforts to expand its data collection methods, with an average number of records grown by around 3700 each year during this period. The fluctuations might be due to changes in survey methodologies or shifts in respondent demographics over time.

DATA RELIABILITY:
Given the significant missing year (2020), it is essential to exercise caution when analyzing data from that span. It's imperative to understand if this omission affected overall trends, particularly those related to pandemic-induced economic impacts. In years before and after 2020, researchers should be aware of potential underrepresentation or overestimation due to the lack of data from that critical period.

KEY TEMPORAL PATTERNS:
1. **Economic Growth (2007-2019):** This period showed robust economic growth with annual average GDP growth rates reaching nearly 3%. The automotive and manufacturing sectors drove this growth, reflecting South Carolina's major industries. Researchers should examine trends in employment and income during this time to understand the state's resilience against economic downturns.

2. **Pandemic Recovery (2021-2023):** The period post-pandemic has seen varying outcomes across sectors, especially tourism and manufacturing. While South Carolina rapidly recovered its manufacturing sector, the state's economy remained vulnerable due to regional disparities in remote work arrangements and dependence on a single industry (manufacturing). Researchers should focus on monitoring shifts in employment patterns post-2021.

3. **Housing Market Appreciation:** The coastal areas, particularly Charleston, have experienced rapid appreciation of housing value relative to the national average since 2019. This trend could reflect booming tourism and industrial activity in these regions but also raises concerns about affordability for both local residents and newcomers. Researchers should investigate factors contributing to this phenomenon, including changes in regulations or infrastructure development.

CAUTIONS FOR RESEARCHERS:
- The pandemic's impact on economic trends is not uniformly distributed across all industries and geographical areas; thus, researchers must disaggregate data by sector and region to understand the full extent of recovery.
- The absence of 2020 in the dataset makes it difficult to assess longitudinal changes or respondent experiences during a significant economic event. This limitation might skew trends if not addressed through alternative methodologies.
- Long-term projections based on this data should consider regional differences, as South Carolina's growth and performance differ significantly from other states in the same period.

INFERENCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Policy Recommendation:** Develop targeted policies to support regions affected by rapid housing market appreciation without exacerbating affordability issues for local residents, such as implementing inclusionary zoning or providing financial assistance for downsizing options.

2. **Research Strategy:** Conduct mixed-methods analysis (quantitative data on economic trends and qualitative studies to understand respondent experiences) to capture the full complexity of South Carolina's post-pandemic recovery, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations like low-income households.

3. **Comparative Analysis:** Extend future analysis to include more comprehensive temporal coverage (e.g., 2017 and beyond) to account for longer-term trends and potential economic disruptions caused by the pandemic's aftermath, especially in regions like South Carolina with significant manufacturing dependencies.

4. **Data Quality Enhancement:** Given the missing year of 2020, researchers should consider alternative data sources (e.g., from state-level surveys or other federal databases) to fill this gap and ensure more robust longitudinal analysis.
