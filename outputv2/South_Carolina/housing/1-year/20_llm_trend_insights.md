4. Policy interventions could focus on maintaining affordability for housing by implementing rent control measures, subsidies to lower-income families, or encouraging investment in low-cost housing projects. For insurance costs, regulatory measures could be taken to prevent excessive price increases while ensuring adequate coverage. Water and utility cost management policies might involve promoting water conservation practices or investing in more efficient infrastructure.

However, they also indicate significant disparities between high-value properties and lower income families, possibly signaling social stratification issues or gaps in access to affordable housing and services.

6. Variables where a trend reversal could have major societal impact include:
   - Decreasing Income_to_FPL_Ratio might widen the financial gap between low-income families and middle/upper-class households, potentially increasing poverty levels if not addressed promptly.
   - A significant reversal in Working Age Persons trend could disrupt labor force dynamics and economic stability, requiring policies that support workforce development or unemployment benefits for affected individuals.
   - If Family Income decreases significantly while Household Income remains stable, it might exacerbate poverty levels and social inequality, necessitating targeted financial assistance programs or wage adjustments to maintain economic stability.

7. Forecasting insights based on these trend analyses could include:
   - Predictive modeling suggests a potential increase in property values due to ongoing economic growth and low-interest rates, potentially reaching new all-time highs within the next decade.
   - The water cost trend indicates a steady rise over the years, suggesting that continued investment in water infrastructure might be necessary to prevent future price surges.
   - With Working Age Persons showing a clear downward trend, there's an increasing dependency ratio, which could pose challenges for social security systems and public services funding without proactive measures like immigration reform or age-friendly policies for older adults.
