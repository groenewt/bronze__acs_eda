1. The MEAN vs MEDIAN comparison for each variable reveals how closely the average value aligns with the central tendency of the dataset, ignoring extreme values (outliers). If median is lower than mean, it suggests that there are more observations closer to zero or near-zero values in the distribution. Conversely, if mean is higher than median, it implies a longer tail towards larger numbers, indicating some skewness. For example, for Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost with an average of 207.49 and a median of 182.00, there seems to be a moderate skewness where the mean is higher than the median, suggesting that while most utility costs are relatively low, there's a significant number of high-cost observations.

2. The SKEWNESS values provide insight into the degree of symmetry or skewness in the data distribution. Values closer to zero indicate symmetric distributions (bimodal, unimodal), positive skewness suggests a longer right tail (mean > median), and negative skewness indicates a longer left tail (mean < median). For instance, Property_Tax_Rate with a skewness of 5.060 implies an extremely skewed distribution where the majority are very low but there's also a significant number at much higher values.

3. The KURTOSIS value represents the "tailedness" or heaviness of the tails in a distribution, compared to a normal distribution (which has kurtosis of 3). Higher-than-normal kurtosis indicates heavy tails and potential outliers; lower than average values suggest lighter tails. For example, Income_to_FPL_Ratio with a high kurtosis value of 28.948 suggests the presence of extreme outliers in this ratio, as it's significantly higher than the majority of other variables' distributions and closer to the maximum possible (which is theoretically unlimited).

4. Key insights about overall data characteristics and quality include:
   - High dispersion observed across most variables, signified by VARIANCE values being larger than their corresponding STD DEV values. This suggests a wide spread in values for each variable. For example, Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost has the highest variance of 21,089.68 and also one of the lowest STD DEV (145.22), indicating substantial variability in utility costs across different individuals or households.
   - Several variables have high skewness values, suggesting distributions that are not perfectly symmetrical around their median value. This could indicate potential for outliers to significantly influence these datasets and might require careful handling when analyzing such data.

5. Three key insights about the overall data characteristics and quality are:
    a) The presence of skewed distributions across many variables, suggesting potential impacts from outliers that could bias statistical analysis if not properly managed.
    b) A high level of dispersion in most datasets (indicated by large variances), which implies there's significant variability within the data. This emphasizes the need for robust statistical methods to handle such unpredictable distributions.
    c) The wide range of values observed across various variables, from near-zero amounts like Flag_First_Mortgage_Payment and Flag_Household_Income (both at 0) to thousands or even tens of thousands in Total_Monthly_Utility_Costs and Property_Tax_Rate. This diversity underscores the broad range of possible values across different categories, necessitating comprehensive data exploration before any meaningful analysis is undertaken.
