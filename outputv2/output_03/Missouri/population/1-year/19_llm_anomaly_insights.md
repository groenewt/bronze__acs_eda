ANOMALIES BY VARIABLE: Public_Assistance_Income

1. **Historical Events or Policy Changes Explaining These Anomalies:**

   - **Year 2021**: The anomaly in the year 2021 could be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impacts. Many states, including Missouri, experienced a surge in unemployment claims during this period due to business closures and reduced consumer spending. Additionally, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 provided additional financial assistance to eligible individuals and families, which might have led to an increase in public assistance income applications compared to expected levels.
   
   - **Year 2022**: The anomaly observed in this year could be attributed to the implementation of the $15 minimum wage policy in Missouri (passed by voters in November 2023 but effective starting January 1, 2023). While not yet fully implemented at this point, it might have increased consumer spending and subsequently public assistance income applications as more people entered the workforce.

2. **Concentration of Anomalies:**

   The anomalies in both years (2021 and 2022) coincide with periods when significant economic events were taking place, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, as well as policy changes related to minimum wage.

3. **Variables Showing Unusual Temporal Patterns:**

   The Public_Assistance_Income variable shows the most unusual temporal pattern due to its significant deviation from expected values in both 2021 and 2022. This discrepancy is largely attributed to economic factors such as COVID-19 impacts, minimum wage policy changes, and broader macroeconomic shifts affecting household income stability.

4. **Nature of Anomalies:**

   These anomalies represent a potential issue with data collection or possibly genuine socioeconomic shifts. While the COVID-19 impacts are clear in both years, it's harder to pinpoint specific policy changes affecting Public_Assistance_Income immediately after its implementation without more detailed analysis of individual applications and their respective contexts.

5. **Implications for Trend Analysis and Forecasting:**

   These anomalies suggest that while the overall trends in public assistance income remain stable, there are significant temporal fluctuations that could skew the accuracy of long-term forecasts without accounting for specific events or policy changes. This underscores the need for more granular analysis to understand the nuanced effects of socioeconomic factors on these metrics.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Detailed Analysis of Application Data**: Conduct an in-depth study of application data from 2021 and 2022, focusing particularly on the impacts of minimum wage changes and COVID-19 economic downturn to understand if these factors drove significant increases or decreases in applications.
   
2. **Policy Impact Assessment**: Analyze the policy implications of minimum wage legislation passed by voters, assessing its immediate effects on public assistance income applications compared to expected levels.

3. **Longitudinal Data Analysis**: Implement a longitudinal study comparing trends in Public_Assistance_Income over several years before and after significant economic events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and policy changes, controlling for other potential influences on income stability. This will help establish robust correlations between these variables.

**Evidence Synthesis:**

Public assistance income data demonstrates significant temporal fluctuations that deviate from expected trends in 2021 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impacts, minimum wage policy changes, and macroeconomic shifts. These anomalies suggest a need for more nuanced analysis of application data and comprehensive assessments of both immediate and long-term effects of socioeconomic factors on public assistance income trends.
