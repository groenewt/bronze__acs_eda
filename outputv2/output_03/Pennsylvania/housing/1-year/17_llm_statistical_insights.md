1. The difference between MEAN (average) and MEDIAN (middle value) for each variable indicates how closely data points cluster around the central tendency of a distribution. For instance, in variables like 'Water Cost' or 'Property Value', where most values are close to zero with only a few outliers, the median is likely to be closer to zero than the mean. This suggests that these distributions might have skewed tails (i.e., data points are more spread towards one end). The implication here is that while MEAN gives an accurate picture of central tendency for most variables, MEDIAN provides a better representation when dealing with potential outliers or skewness in the data distribution.

2. The SKEWNESS values indicate whether distributions are symmetric or asymmetric (skewed) around their mean. For example, if SKEWNESS is greater than 0, it suggests a positive skew where the tail extends towards higher values on one side of the curve. If negative, it signifies a negative skew with lower values extending outwards from the right-hand end. Highly skewed distributions (like 'Gross Rent' and 'Property Value') suggest that there are significant differences between high and low values in these variables, which could influence further analysis or modeling outcomes.

3. The KURTOSIS value ranges from -2 to 0. Positive kurtosis suggests a distribution has heavy tails (outliers), while negative kurtosis implies lighter tails indicating fewer outliers. For instance, the 'Water Cost' variable, with its high kurtosis of 7.337, indicates that it is more likely for water costs to deviate significantly from the mean compared to other variables like 'Income'. 

4. Variables showing high VARIANCE or STD DEV (the square root of variance) include both income-related variables ('Gross Rent', 'Household Income') and utility cost variables ('Total Monthly Utility Cost'). These high values imply that these data points are spread over a wide range, indicating high variability. The reason for this could be due to economic fluctuations or individual financial behaviors.

5. Three key insights about the overall data characteristics and quality:
    - High skewness in 'Gross Rent' and 'Property Value' variables suggests that there might be significant differences between high and low values, which should be taken into account when interpreting results of any analysis involving these metrics. 
    - The presence of outliers (as indicated by positive SKEWNESS for 'Water Cost') implies the need to handle such data points carefully in statistical analyses or machine learning models to avoid skewing results due to extreme values.
    - High variance across income-related and utility cost variables indicates considerable variability, which could reflect economic disparities within the dataset or broader trends in societal income distribution and living costs. This also underscores the importance of appropriate data transformations (like log or Box Cox transformation) when dealing with such skewed distributions to improve model performance.
