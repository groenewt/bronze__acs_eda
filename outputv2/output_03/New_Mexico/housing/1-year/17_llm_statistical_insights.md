1. Mean vs Median Comparison: The mean provides an average value of a dataset, while the median gives the middle value when data is ordered from least to greatest. In many cases, especially for skewed distributions (like some income groups or utility costs), the mean can be significantly different from the median due to outliers pulling the average up or down. For instance, in the case of Total Monthly Utility Costs, the mean is 172.07 but the median is only 140.00. This suggests that while there's a strong central tendency represented by the mean, the distribution has considerable variability and outliers that pull it away from the middle value.

2. SKEWNESS Values: SKEWNESS measures how asymmetric (skewed) a distribution is around its mean. A positive skewness indicates a right-skewed distribution (a long tail to the right), while a negative skewness shows a left-skewed distribution (long tail to the left). In our dataset, many of these distributions exhibit significant skewness, suggesting substantial asymmetry in their underlying data. For example, Total Monthly Utility Costs have a very high positive skewness value (11.270), indicating that while there are some lower costs, most values are significantly higher and the right tail is much heavier than the left.

3. KURTOSIS: This measures the "tailedness" of the distribution, specifically how heavy or light these tails are relative to a normal distribution. A value greater than 0 indicates a peaked or leptokurtic distribution (more outliers), while values below zero indicate a platykurtic distribution (less extreme but more frequent lower values). All our datasets show positive KURTOSIS, indicating the presence of heavy tails and potential for extreme outliers. For instance, Total Monthly Utility Costs also exhibits high kurtosis (257.186), suggesting significant variability in these costs with a higher frequency of more expensive options compared to what would be expected from a normal distribution.

4. Variance/STD DEV: These measures reflect the spread or dispersion of data points around the mean. In our dataset, many variables have high variance and standard deviation values, indicating that the data is relatively spread out and there's considerable variation in these datasets. For instance, Total Monthly Utility Costs (27,567.11) show a much higher dispersion than the other utility-related variables like Water Cost (0.08), suggesting this dataset contains more expensive utility costs on average compared to others.

5. Key Insights:
   - The data demonstrates substantial variability and skewness in many aspects, highlighting potential outliers and non-normal distributions. This suggests that caution should be exercised when making generalizations or predictions from these datasets without considering the specific characteristics of each variable.
   - There's considerable disparity in total monthly utility costs (122,903) compared to other utilities like water cost (9.654), indicating a significant variance and suggesting that energy usage may be more diverse than just residential electricity and water consumption.
   - The wide range of income levels across the dataset implies a broad spectrum of financial situations, which could have implications for policy-making or service distribution in various socioeconomic contexts.

In summary, while this comprehensive data set provides valuable insights into diverse aspects of consumer spending, it also underscores the importance of understanding each variable's specific characteristics and potential outliers to draw accurate conclusions and make informed decisions based on these data.
