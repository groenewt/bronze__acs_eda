1. **Top Three Strongest Correlations:**

   - Total_Person_Income and Wage_Income (r = 0.925): This correlation reveals a strong linear relationship between total income of an individual or household and their wage-based income. The high positive value indicates that as the total person's income increases, so does their wage-based earnings. This suggests that non-wage income sources like capital gains, social benefits, or other assets significantly contribute to overall wealth accumulation for most New Mexicans.
   
   - Median_Household_Income and Population_Size (r = 0.914): Here, the correlation indicates a strong linear relationship between median household income per capita in a PUMA and its population size. This finding underscores that larger populations tend to have higher average incomes due to economies of scale, more diverse skill sets within workforces, and potentially broader consumer bases for businesses.
   
   - Median_Household_Income and Education_Attainment (r = 0.892): This correlation suggests a strong linear relationship between median household income per capita in PUMAs and the proportion of residents with at least a bachelor's degree or higher education attainment. Higher education levels typically correlate with better-paying jobs, indicating that as educational attainment increases within New Mexico communities, so does average household income.

2. **Expected vs. Surprising Correlations:**

   - The strong positive correlation between Total_Person_Income and Wage_Income is expected given the nature of these two measures of economic well-being—wages being a significant portion of total income for most individuals or families in New Mexico, driven by factors such as industries (oil & gas extraction, government), demographics (population growth, migration patterns) and geographical features.

   - The correlation between Median_Household_Income and Population_Size is also expected due to the well-established economic principle of "economies of scale" – larger populations tend to support higher average incomes through broader markets, diverse skill sets, and increased consumer spending power.

   - The correlation between Median_Household_Income and Education_Attainment is also expected as education generally leads to better job opportunities with higher wages.

3. **Causal Relationship vs. Spurious Correlation:**

   - These correlations are causally driven – the variables in question (Total_Person_Income, Median_Household_Income, and Education_Attainment) influence each other through direct effects or mediators such as employment opportunities, wage structures, skill development, and income mobility.

4. **Negative Correlations Suggest Trade-offs:**

   - Negative correlations between Total_Person_Income and Housing_Value (r = -0.35) suggest that higher housing costs may negatively impact overall wealth accumulation for households in New Mexico, possibly due to the high proportion of low-wage earners or those working multiple jobs.

5. **Policy Implications:**

   - Policymakers should focus on strategies to increase median incomes without compromising affordable housing options, such as investing in education and job training programs that improve employment prospects for lower-income residents.
   
   - Encouraging economic diversification away from oil & gas extraction could help reduce reliance on volatile commodity prices and lessen the impact of price fluctuations on income stability.

6. **Follow-up Analyses:**

   - Investigate the relative contribution of different wage sources (salaries vs. capital gains) to total household income, given their distinct tax implications and economic behaviors.
   
   - Examine regional disparities in education attainment and its impact on median income levels across various PUMAs within New Mexico.
   
   - Analyze the correlation between housing costs and non-wage forms of wealth (e.g., retirement savings, property values) to better understand how households save for future economic security despite high living expenses.

7. **Missing Correlations:**

   - There is no significant negative correlation between Total_Person_Income and Population_Size in New Mexico (r ≈ 0). This absence may be due to the state's relatively smaller population size compared to other states with large, diverse economies. However, a more comprehensive analysis would require examining data from multiple years to ensure this is not an anomaly.
