1. **MEAN vs MEDIAN Difference**: The mean is a measure of central tendency that gives equal weight to each data point, whereas the median represents the middle value in a sorted list of data points. A significant difference between these two indicates a dataset skewed towards higher or lower values. For instance, if the mean of income per hour is significantly higher than the median, it suggests that there are some very high-paying jobs contributing disproportionately to overall earnings.

2. **SKEWNESS Values**: Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution about its mean. A positive skew indicates a right skew (long tail on the right side), while a negative skew implies left skew (tail on the left). If the skewness value is close to zero, it suggests the data distribution is approximately symmetric. Positive skewness in income distributions would indicate that there are more high-income earners than low-income ones, which could be an issue of economic disparity.

3. **KURTOSIS**: Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. A kurtosis value greater than 3 indicates heavy tails or outliers (leptokurtic), while values less than 3 suggest lighter tails or lack of outliers (platykurtic). If we observe high kurtosis in our data, it implies that there are a few extreme values contributing heavily to the overall distribution. For instance, if many individuals have exceptionally high incomes, this would be evident from high kurtosis.

4. **VARIANCE/STD DEV**: Variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean and represents how far numbers in a data set are spread out from their average value. Standard deviation (SD) is simply the square root of variance, providing a measure of dispersion in terms of the original units of measurement. High SD or variance indicates high variability among data points—more extreme values are possible compared to datasets with lower standard deviations.

5. **Key Insights**:
   - **Data Quality**: The fact that 206,945 individuals (out of 216,867) experience poverty suggests a concerning level of income inequality. This high poverty rate coupled with the skewed nature of many variables implies significant disparities in wealth distribution across this population.
   - **Income Disparity**: Given that the mean income per hour is much higher than the median, it indicates a substantial concentration of earnings at the top end of the spectrum. This could be due to high-paying jobs or business owners skewing the average upward without necessarily reflecting true middle class levels.
   - **Economic Disparity**: The skewed income distributions (especially around mean and median) suggest substantial economic disparities among individuals in this population, with a significant number of people earning very low wages or no income at all compared to those who significantly exceed the average. This highlights the urgent need for policies that promote equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities.
