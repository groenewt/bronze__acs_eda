1. **Research Question 1: Long-term trends in economic mobility**
   - Key Variables: Income_Adjustment_Factor, Flag_Household_Income, Gross_Rent, Household_Income, Annual_Rent_to_Value_Ratio
   - Appropriate Analytical Methods: Regression analysis and panel data models (e.g., fixed effects or random effects) to isolate changes in economic mobility over time.
   - Expected Policy Implications: Identifying areas where policies can improve the intergenerational transmission of income, such as early childhood education initiatives or investment in quality public schools in low-income neighborhoods.

2. **Research Question 2: Housing affordability and its impact on access to essential services**
   - Key Variables: Annual_Rent_to_Value_Ratio, Property_Value, Meals_Included_in_Rent, Flag_Bedrooms, Bedrooms_Score, Annual_Rent_to_Value_Ratio, Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost
   - Appropriate Analytical Methods: Multivariate regression models to examine the relationship between housing affordability and access to essential services (healthcare, education).
   - Expected Policy Implications: Policymakers could consider incentives for developers to include utilities or reduce rents in low-income areas, thereby improving overall quality of life.

3. **Research Question 3: Demographic changes and their economic implications**
   - Key Variables: Same_Sex_Married_Couple, Structure_Age, Working_Age_Persons, Dependency_Ratio
   - Appropriate Analytical Methods: Age-stratified regression analysis to assess the impact of demographic shifts on labor force participation and income.
   - Expected Policy Implications: Understanding these trends can inform policies aimed at promoting age diversity in the workforce or supporting single-parent households, particularly those headed by women.

2. **Longitudinal Analysis:** The dataset's temporal coverage allows for analyzing changes in economic conditions over time. By comparing annual data from 2007 to 2019 with later years (2020 and onwards), researchers can identify how specific events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have influenced economic trends and housing markets. This analysis will also help understand recovery patterns post-pandemic and potential lasting impacts on certain demographic or geographical groups.

3. **Cross-sectional Comparisons:** Analyzing data from different years in the same PUMA can reveal regional variations in economic conditions, housing affordability, and demographic changes within Oklahoma itself. For instance, comparing rural vs urban areas over time can illuminate how economic shifts are playing out differently across these regions.

4. **Visualizations:**
   - A line graph showing the evolution of median income from 2007 to 2023 for different age groups in Oklahoma would highlight generational wealth disparities.
   - An interactive map displaying changes in housing affordability across PUMAs over time can reveal trends and potential hotspots of need for policy interventions.
   - A scatter plot comparing the relationship between education attainment and median income, stratified by gender, would provide insights into how educational investments are translating into economic outcomes.

5. **Methodological Challenges & Limitations:**
   - Due to the non-overlapping nature of PUMAs, it may be challenging to directly compare regions with different population densities or urbanization levels. Researchers should consider methods like spatial interpolation for large-scale comparisons.
   - The dataset's reliance on administrative records might introduce sampling biases that could distort the true picture of economic conditions and demographic trends in Oklahoma. It would be essential to use robust statistical techniques, possibly supplemented by qualitative data where possible, to account for these potential biases.
