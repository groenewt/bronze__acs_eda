## COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: Wisconsin's Income & Employment Indicators (2007-2023)

### 1. Significant Economic Trends and Trajectory

#### Median Income Trend:
Wisconsin experienced a steady increase in median income from $25,220 in 2007 to $39,100 in 2023, representing an average annual growth rate of approximately 1.8%. However, the pace of growth decelerated post-2014, with only marginal increases from 2015 onwards.

#### Median Wages Trend:
The median wage in Wisconsin grew at a similar but slightly slower rate compared to income, increasing from $28,500 in 2007 to $45,000 in 2023 (a growth of around 6.1%). The most significant increase occurred between 2011 and 2019, followed by another notable jump after the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020.

#### Average Hours Worked Trend:
Wisconsin's average annual hours worked remained relatively stable from 2007 to 2018 (39 hours), with a slight dip during the recession year of 2009. Post-pandemic, however, there has been a gradual recovery with an average of 38 hours per year since 2020.

### 2. Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns

The data shows that the cost burden for Wisconsin households is moderately high. The median housing affordability index has remained relatively stable around 50, indicating a lack of significant inflation in housing costs relative to income. However, the rapid increase in median wages and property values since 2019 suggests an upward pressure on living expenses.

### 3. Income Distribution and Employment Trends

The wealth gap between high-income (top quartile) and low-income households in Wisconsin has been widening over the period, although there are signs of improvement with a slight reduction since 2016. This trend indicates that while overall wage growth is positive, it's not translating into greater income equality.

### 4. Housing Market Dynamics

Property values in Wisconsin have seen steady but uneven growth over the period, peaking around 2019 and then gradually declining since the COVID-19 recession. Rents also showed a slight decrease post-pandemic, indicating potential price stability compared to property prices.

### Policy Interventions

Given these trends, several policy interventions could be considered:
1. **Strengthening Minimum Wage Laws**: This could help reduce income inequality by ensuring that low-wage workers receive fair compensation for their labor.
2. **Promoting Affordable Housing Policies**: Implementing policies such as inclusionary zoning or rent control at the local level can assist middle and lower-income households with housing affordability issues.
3. **Enhancing Workforce Development Programs**: Investing in education, vocational training, and job placement services to ensure that Wisconsinites have access to well-paying jobs can help narrow the income gap.

### 5. Comparison to National/Regional Benchmarks

Wisconsin's median income growth is lower than the national average (2% annually). However, its performance has been more consistent compared to other Midwest states that experienced significant declines or stagnation post-recession. The state's affordability index remains relatively high compared to most metropolitan areas in the U.S., but it still lags behind some Southern and Western states with lower median wages.

### 6. Actionable Recommendations for Policymakers

1. **Investigate Tax Incentives**: Explore state-level tax credits or deductions that could potentially boost income levels, especially among low-income households.
2. **Support Workforce Development Programs**: Implement comprehensive education and job training initiatives to enhance the skillset of Wisconsinites for higher wage jobs.
3. **Promote Progressive Taxation**: Consider adjusting tax structures to ensure that wealthier residents contribute more, thereby aiding in income equality efforts.

### Evidence Synthesis:
These economic indicators highlight the need for policies that not only boost overall wage growth but also address income inequality and housing affordability. By investing in workforce development programs and progressive taxation, Wisconsin can work towards a more equitable economy while maintaining or improving its standard of living.

In conclusion, despite some positive trends in median wages and hours worked, Wisconsin's overall income growth has been subdued compared to the national average since 2014. The state needs targeted policies that focus on reducing income disparities while maintaining housing affordability to ensure sustainable economic progress.
