**Comprehensive Economic Analysis: Wisconsin Housing Market Trends (2007-2023)**

1. **Significant Economic Trends**:
   - Property Values have shown a steady upward trajectory, peaking at $240,000 in 2023 and then declining to $250,000 by the end of 2023. This represents growth despite market fluctuations from 2017-2019 due to economic recovery and government stimuli.
   - Rental Market trends show a robust increase in rental prices ($460 per month on average in 2023, up from $840 in 2019), reflecting the strong demand for housing despite limited new supply due to affordability constraints and policy interventions.
   - The owner-tenant cost burden has remained relatively stable at around 23%, with renters bearing a slightly higher proportion, indicating that while homeownership is still accessible, financial stress related to housing costs remains for many households.

2. **Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns**:
   - The most affected populations include low-income families ($15,000-$34,999 annual income) who are disproportionately priced out of the market as rental costs escalate significantly (from $763 in 2015 to $880 in 2021).
   - Middle-income households ($35,000-$74,999 annual income) also face financial strain due to rising home values and rents.

3. **Income Distribution and Employment Trends**:
   - The trend suggests an overall improvement in employment opportunities, with job growth averaging around 2% annually from 2017-2023 compared to the national average of 1.4%. However, wage stagnation among lower-income groups persists, indicating a widening income gap.
   - The manufacturing sector has been a significant driver of employment growth in Wisconsin over this period, with high-skilled labor jobs becoming more prevalent alongside traditional factory work.

4. **Housing Market Dynamics**:
   - There's evidence that property values and rents are moving in tandem, albeit at different rates ($150 per month increase for renters compared to $36,000 annual gain for homeowners). This suggests a market reaching equilibrium but still experiencing significant disparities.

5. **Policy Interventions**:
   - Given the trends of increasing housing costs and stagnant wages among lower-income groups, policymakers should consider implementing inclusionary zoning policies to increase affordable homeownership opportunities in favorable areas.
   - Additionally, investing in public transportation infrastructure could help mitigate rent burden by facilitating access to job centers for those living further from urban hubs.

6. **Comparison to National/Regional Benchmarks**:
   - Compared to the national average, Wisconsin's housing market has shown resilience in maintaining affordability despite a robust economic recovery. However, it lags behind regions like California and Nevada regarding both property values and rents.

7. **Actionable Recommendations**:
   - Policymakers should prioritize initiatives that support low- to moderate-income households in accessing homeownership, such as expanding down payment assistance programs or providing tax credits for first-time buyers.
   - Implementing policies to increase the availability of affordable housing units could help alleviate rent burden and preserve existing home ownership opportunities for lower-income families.
   - Encouraging job creation in sectors with higher wages, such as technology or healthcare, could provide alternative pathways for income growth that do not heavily rely on the real estate market.

**Evidence Synthesis**: The data indicates a gradual but persistent upward trend in Wisconsin's housing market, driven by robust economic recovery and government supportive policies. While property values have shown resilience compared to national averages, rental affordability remains an issue for middle-income households. Addressing these imbalances through targeted policy interventions will be crucial in ensuring long-term housing equity in the state.
