1. MEAN vs MEDIAN: The mean (average) is a measure of central tendency that reflects the typical value in a dataset, while the median provides insight into the middle value when data points are arranged in order. In many cases, especially for skewed distributions (where one tail extends further than the other), the mean and median can differ significantly. For instance, for variables like 'Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost' or 'Household_Income', where the majority of values are clustered at lower ends with occasional high outliers, the mean would be more influenced by these extreme values compared to the median. This discrepancy suggests that while the data points in this region have a significant impact on their overall averages, they do not necessarily represent typical or central instances of these variables.

2. SKEWNESS: The skewness value measures how asymmetric is the distribution around its mean (or median). A positive skewness indicates an asymmetrical distribution with a longer tail extending towards higher values, while negative skewness suggests a long tail in the direction of lower values. Higher absolute skewness imply greater departure from normality or symmetry. For instance, 'Specified_Rent_Unit' has extremely high positive skewness (close to 3), indicating that most units are zero and there are very few non-zero entries. This suggests a highly skewed distribution towards no rent being paid for many properties.

3. KURTOSIS: The kurtosis value indicates the heaviness of tails in a distribution, comparing it with a normal distribution. A positive kurtosis (>0) implies heavier tails (more extreme values), while negative kurtosis (<0) suggests lighter-tailed distributions. High absolute kurtosis values indicate greater likelihood of outliers or 'fat tails'. For example, the 'Specified_Value_Unit' has extremely high positive kurtosis (>10), suggesting a distribution with many properties having very high value scores. This implies that there are likely to be fewer, but higher-value units in this dataset compared to a normal distribution.

4. VARIANCE/STD DEV: The variance measures the spread of data around the mean, while standard deviation (SD) is just the square root of variance. A larger variance or SD indicates greater dispersion - that is, more values are spread farther from the mean. For instance, 'Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost' and 'Property_Tax_Rate' have high variances and standard deviations, reflecting substantial differences in these variables among individuals/properties. These large fluctuations could be due to factors like weather conditions affecting utility usage or varying property tax rates across different regions.

5. Key insights about overall data characteristics and quality:
   a) The presence of skewness suggests that some datasets have an imbalance, with most values concentrated around the mean/median but there are outliers or extreme values on one side (positive or negative). This may necessitate specialized handling for statistical analysis.
   
   b) High kurtosis indicates the potential existence of 'fat tails' – higher-than-normal occurrence of extreme values, which could pose challenges in risk assessment and forecasting if these tail extremes are not accounted for properly.
   
c) The wide dispersions across most variables (evident from high variances/standard deviations), while normal distribution might suggest a central tendency towards the mean or median, also implies that there is significant variation among individuals/properties in many areas, which could be beneficial for stratified analysis and targeted interventions.

d) Despite some outliers (like 'Flag_Second_Mortgage_Payment' with skewed negative kurtosis), the majority of variables show relatively symmetric distributions, suggesting that most data points cluster around a central tendency point.
