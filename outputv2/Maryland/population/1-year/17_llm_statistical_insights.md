1. Mean vs Median: The mean (average) value for each variable can vary slightly from its median (middle value) due to outliers or skewness in the data distribution. For instance, income per hour shows a significant difference between mean and median; this suggests that while most individuals earn less than an hourly wage of $34.15, there are some who earn considerably more. This could imply disparities in the workforce or specific industries where high-paying jobs exist but might be outliers compared to the overall distribution.

2. SKEWNESS values: The skewness of a distribution indicates whether it is symmetric (0) around its mean, positively skewed (positive value) with a tail extending towards higher values, or negatively skewed (negative value) with a tail extending towards lower values. In our dataset, the skewness values range from -0.824 to 9.409 for age and Flag_Age respectively; these high positive values suggest that distributions are heavily right-skewed, indicating that there are more individuals at the higher end of the spectrum compared to the lower. This could imply a trend where older individuals or those with higher incomes are overrepresented in our dataset.

3. KURTOSIS: Kurtosis quantifies the "tailedness" of the distribution, specifically measuring whether it is heavier (leptokurtic) than a normal distribution, lighter (platykurtic), or has no significant tails at all. The kurtosis values for our dataset range from -0.701 to 4.959 for various Flag variables and 38.438 to 5198.958 for Income_Per_Hour. Heavy-tailed distributions (higher kurtosis) are common in finance, insurance, and risk management as they account for extreme events or losses more effectively than light-tailed ones. The high kurtosis values indicate that our dataset has significant outliers, with the highest value for Income_Per_Hour suggesting an extremely skewed distribution of income within this group.

4. VARIANCE/STD DEV: Variables showing higher dispersion typically have larger variances and standard deviations due to more variation in their values. The variables that show high variance include Flag_Age (0.12), Flag_Interest_Dividend_Income (0.33), Flag_Other_Income (0.31), Flag_Retirement_Income (0.31), Flag_Self_Employment_Income (0.27), Flag_Social_Security_Income (0.32), and Income_Per_Hour (64.88). The high variability in these variables could reflect the volatility or unpredictability of incomes from specific sources, such as age-related changes, variable dividend income, self-employment earnings, social security benefits, etc., over time or across individuals within the dataset.

5. Key insights:
   - The dataset shows a significant concentration of high and low values (outliers), with some variables exhibiting substantial skewness. This suggests that while there is diversity in income levels among these categories, they are not evenly distributed but rather tend to lean towards certain extremes.
   - Among the individual Flag variables, those related to age (Flag_Age) and specific types of income (Flag_Interest_Dividend_Income, Flag_Other_Income, Flag_Retirement_Income, Flag_Self_Employment_Income, Flag_Social_Security_Income), show considerable skewness. This could imply disparities in the distributions or that these groups have more variability than others within their respective categories.
   - The variance and standard deviation for Income_Per_Hour indicate an extremely wide range of incomes across individuals working hourly, suggesting high income volatility even among those with stable work hours. This could be due to fluctuations in job markets or earning potential over time.
