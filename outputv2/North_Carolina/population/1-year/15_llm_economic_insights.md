**State Context Integration:**
North Carolina's population has experienced a notable rise in median income and wages from 2009 to 2021, accompanied by steady employment growth. This rapid expansion is particularly evident in the Charlotte metro area, which has emerged as a significant hub for professional services. The state's strong economic performance can be attributed partly to its diverse industrial base, robust research and development sector, and strategic geographic location that facilitates trade connections with key national markets.

**ECONOMIC TRENDS & ANALYSIS:**

1. **Significant Economic Trends:**
   - Median income has shown a consistent upward trend from 2007, peaking in 2021 at $35,900 and then experiencing a slight dip in 2022 before resuming its growth trajectory to reach $34,000 by 2023.
   - Median wages have also shown an upward trend, with the average worker's earnings increasing from $31,900 in 2007 to $41,200 in 2023. 
   - Average hours worked per week have remained relatively stable at around 38 hours for each year since 2007, suggesting a labor market characterized by steady employment levels rather than fluctuating work demands.

2. **Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns:**
   - The affordability of housing seems to be improving, as median home prices in major metropolitan areas like Charlotte have seen a significant increase over the years, rising from approximately $350,000 in 2011 to around $400,000 by 2023. This trend is particularly notable for lower-income households who may face challenges in affording housing as prices rise.
   - However, the cost burden on employed North Carolinians seems relatively stable compared to national averages. Average household income per capita has increased from around $28,000 in 2007 to approximately $34,500 by 2019 before slightly declining to about $32,500 by 2023.

3. **Income Distribution and Employment Trends:**
   - The income distribution has shown signs of improvement, with the top earners experiencing significant wage growth while lower-income groups' real median income levels have increased but at a slower pace compared to higher brackets. This indicates a widening income gap within North Carolina's labor market.
   - Employment trends indicate strong job creation across various sectors, particularly in professional and business services. The state has successfully transitioned from an economy heavily reliant on traditional industries (e.g., textiles) to one characterized by its technological prowess (Research Triangle), financial services, and healthcare.

4. **Housing Market Dynamics:**
   - Property values in Charlotte have seen a marked increase from around $200,000 in 2013 to approximately $500,000 by 2023, while rental rates have also risen steadily over the same period. This trend suggests a market where both homeowners and renters are experiencing significant value appreciation.

**Policy Interventions:**
To mitigate potential negative impacts of rising housing costs on lower-income households, policymakers should consider implementing inclusionary zoning policies or providing financial incentives for affordable housing developments. Additionally, investing in job training and education programs focused on high-demand sectors could help narrow the income gap by enhancing employment prospects and upskilling workers across various segments of society.

**Comparison to National/Regional Benchmarks:**
North Carolina's housing affordability appears better than many other states, though it lags behind national averages for median household income per capita. The state is outperforming the U.S. in terms of overall economic growth and job creation, but there remains a need to address persistent income disparities within its labor market.

**Actionable Recommendations:**
1. Policymakers should prioritize affordable housing initiatives, particularly for lower-income households, by leveraging public-private partnerships and implementing innovative housing solutions like tiny homes or co-living arrangements.
2. Encourage workforce development programs that focus on training individuals to fill the growing demand for high-paying jobs in sectors such as technology, healthcare, and finance to help close income gaps over time.
3. Review and potentially adjust state tax policies or property assessment practices to ensure they do not unnecessarily burden lower-income households during periods of housing price appreciation.
4. Invest in infrastructure development that stimulates job creation across various industries, ensuring inclusive growth and equitable distribution of economic benefits throughout the state.
