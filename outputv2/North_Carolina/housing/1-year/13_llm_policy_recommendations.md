1. **Research Questions:**

   a. **Q1: Analyzing Income Trends and Their Impact on Poverty Levels in North Carolina (2007-2023):**
      - Key Variables to Analyze: Family_Income, Household_Income, Income_to_FPL_Ratio, Median_Household_Income.
      - Appropriate Methods: Regression analysis, panel data techniques (fixed or random effects).
      - Expected Policy Implications: Identify areas where income growth has been most effective in reducing poverty and inform targeted interventions for those regions still struggling with high poverty rates.

   b. **Q2: Examining Housing Affordability Trends Over Time:**
      - Key Variables to Analyze: Annual_Rent_to_Value_Ratio, Property_Tax_Rate, Gross_Rent_Percentage_Income, Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost.
      - Appropriate Methods: Longitudinal analysis using panel data techniques and regression models that control for economic cycles and policy changes.
      - Expected Policy Implications: Pinpoint regions with significant housing affordability challenges to prioritize interventions such as rent subsidies, tax incentives for developers, or land-use policies promoting mixed-income communities.

   c. **Q3: Investigating the Relationship between Demographic Shifts and Economic Performance:**
      - Key Variables to Analyze: Structure_Age, Structure_Age_Score, Working_Age_Persons, Dependency_Ratio.
      - Appropriate Methods: Time-series analysis, regression discontinuity design, or difference-in-differences comparisons with a control group (if available).
      - Expected Policy Implications: Uncover the relationship between demographic changes and economic performance to inform policies related to immigration reform, workforce development, or aging populations' needs.

2. **Longitudinal Analyses:**
   The dataset's temporal coverage allows for longitudinal analysis of trends in income levels, housing affordability, and demographic changes over time within North Carolina. This can help identify shifts, determine the rate of change, and evaluate the effectiveness of past policies or interventions.

3. **Cross-Sectional Comparisons:**
   Cross-sectional comparisons between different years can reveal trends in economic growth, housing affordability, and demographic changes across time periods. This could include comparing income levels in 2017 to those in 2023, or contrasting pre-pandemic data with post-pandemic findings.

4. **Visualizations:**
   - Line graphs showing the evolution of median household incomes and poverty rates over time.
   - Heatmaps highlighting changes in housing affordability indices across different regions within North Carolina.
   - Bar charts comparing demographic shifts (e.g., age distribution, ethnicity) between 2017 and 2023.

5. **Methodological Challenges/Limitations:**
   - Data quality: Ensure the accuracy of reported incomes, rental costs, and property values to avoid biases in analyses.
   - Seasonality effects: Account for year-to-year variations that might not reflect broader trends within a state or region.
   - Endogeneity issues with policy interventions: Disentangle the effect of policies from other factors influencing economic and demographic outcomes.

6. **Recommendations:**
   - Integrate additional data sources, such as census tract-level socioeconomic indicators, to provide a more granular understanding of local dynamics.
   - Conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings under various model assumptions or exclusion criteria for variables.
   - Foster interdisciplinary collaboration between economists, demographers, and urban planners to ensure policy recommendations are well-informed by both quantitative data and qualitative insights from other disciplines.
