1. The difference between Mean (MEAN) and Median for each variable indicates how closely the central tendency is located to the actual value of the dataset. In general, if the MEAN is close to the MEDIAN, it suggests a symmetric distribution around the center point of the data set. However, if there's a significant discrepancy (MEAN > MEDIAN), as seen in some variables like 'Water Cost' and 'Selected Monthly Owner Costs', it implies that while most values cluster around the middle, there are outliers or skewed distributions causing higher central tendency.

2. The SKEWNESS value provides insight into the symmetry of a distribution. A positive SKEWNESS indicates a left-skewed (tail extends towards lower values), a negative SKEWNESS implies right-skewness (tail extends towards higher values) and zero suggests a perfectly symmetric distribution. If distributions are skewed, it could mean there's an overrepresentation or underrepresentation of extreme highs or lows in the dataset, which might be indicative of specific outliers or influential data points that significantly impact the overall statistics.

3. KURTOSIS measures the "tailedness" of the probability distribution. A normal (Gaussian) distribution has a kurtosis value of 0; values greater than zero indicate a "leptokurtic" distribution, meaning there are more extreme deviations from the mean compared to a normal distribution (heavy tails). Negative kurtosis implies that the distribution is "platykurtic", having lighter tails. The KURTOSIS value of 0 for all variables indicates that they follow a Gaussian-like pattern with no significant deviation in terms of extreme values, suggesting overall stability and regularity in their data distributions.

4. High VARIANCE or STANDARD DEVIATION (STD DEV) values suggest high dispersion within the dataset—in other words, there is considerable spread among the data points from one another. This could be due to outliers that significantly influence the overall statistics or a highly variable characteristic inherent in the population being measured. For instance, 'Water Cost' and 'Selected Monthly Owner Costs' have high STD DEV values indicating substantial variation across these categories compared to other variables like income or property value.

5. Key insights about the overall data characteristics and quality could include:
   a) The presence of skewed distributions (like in Water Cost and Selected Monthly Owner Costs) suggests that while most observations are close to the center, there might be significant outliers which need careful consideration during analysis or reporting.
   b) High variance across many variables indicates consistency but also potential for extreme values to impact overall results substantially, especially when analyzing means or averages. This highlights the importance of robust statistical methods and possibly data transformations (like logarithmic scaling) in handling such datasets.
   c) Overall, while most distributions are symmetric and have low kurtosis, there is a notable presence of skewness across some variables, which signifies the need for careful examination of outliers or influential data points to ensure accurate interpretation and analysis of results.
