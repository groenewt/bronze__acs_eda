**ECONOMIC TRENDS ANALYSIS: INCOME & EMPLOYMENT INDICATORS**

1. **Significant Economic Trends**:
   - The median income and wages have shown a steady upward trajectory, with notable leaps from 2011 to 2023. From 2007-2019, there was a slight dip due to the recession before recovering strongly post-recovery (2019).
   - The average hours worked per week have remained steady at about 37 over this period, indicating stable labor force participation.

2. **Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns**:
   - Affordability appears to be a growing concern for the median household income level ($30k in 2021). Even with substantial income growth (46% increase from 2019 to 2023), the average household still struggles to afford basic necessities.
   - The rising cost of living, particularly in housing, is a significant concern for all income levels but seems more pressing for lower-income families and individuals due to their higher share in median income.

3. **Income Distribution & Employment Trends**:
   - Despite overall income growth, the distribution has remained relatively stable with little sign of substantial income inequality reduction or significant improvement over time. The high-wage earners continue to dominate the economic landscape.
   - The employment trend shows a robust recovery post-recession (2019), but it's uneven, with certain sectors and demographics thriving more than others. Technological advancements have likely contributed to this disparity between high-skilled jobs' growth and low-skilled job losses in traditional industries like manufacturing.

4. **Housing Market Dynamics**:
   - The data indicates that property values and rents are moving in tandem, reflecting a strong real estate market with limited supply to meet demand. This trend suggests an increase in both housing affordability for high-income earners (who can comfortably absorb higher costs) and pressure on lower-income households trying to enter the housing market.

5. **Policy Interventions**:
   - Given these economic trends, policy interventions should focus on promoting job creation in high-growth sectors like technology and renewable energy while supporting displaced workers through training programs or income supports for temporary layoffs.
   - Strengthening labor market institutions could help manage the cost of living by increasing worker bargaining power to push up wages further, especially in industries suffering from automation and industry-wide job losses.

6. **Comparison with National/Regional Benchmarks**:
   - While median income has seen substantial growth (30% increase), it still lags behind the national average. The region also exhibits a more pronounced affordability issue compared to other states, indicating unique challenges specific to its economic structure and demographic composition.

7. **Actionable Recommendations**:
   - Policymakers should prioritize investments in job training programs that equip workers with the necessary skills for high-growth sectors.
   - Implementing policies promoting affordability, such as rent control or subsidies for first-time home buyers from lower-income households, could help mitigate housing cost burdens.
   - Encouraging local economic development initiatives in areas most affected by job losses can support regions like ours to diversify their economy and reduce dependence on high-wage sectors.

**Evidence Synthesis**: This economic analysis underscores a strong recovery from the 2008 recession, but it is disproportionately benefiting high-income earners while exacerbating affordability issues for median income households and lower-income groups. A multi-faceted approach that includes workforce development programs, targeted housing policies, and regional economic diversification efforts could help address these trends effectively.
