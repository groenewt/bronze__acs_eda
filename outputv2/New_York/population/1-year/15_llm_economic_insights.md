**ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: INCOME & EMPLOYMENT INDICATORS**

1. **Significant Economic Trends and Trajectory**:
   - Median Income (2023): The median income in the state shows a steady increase from 2007 through 2023, peaking at $40,000 per year. This trajectory reflects overall economic growth, particularly in sectors like finance and technology.
   - Median Wages (2023): The average wage has also risen steadily over the years, suggesting stronger employment opportunities for higher-skilled workers. This trend indicates productivity gains and potentially a shift towards more knowledge-intensive jobs in the state's economy.
   - Avg Hours Worked (2019): The average number of hours worked per person has remained relatively stable, indicating that labor force participation rates are high.

2. **Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns**:
   - Affordable populations: While the median income exceeds the national average in 2023, a significant portion of households still faces affordability challenges due to stagnant wage growth over recent years (17% had less than $50,000). This situation disproportionately affects lower-income workers.
   - High-cost areas: The high median income does not eliminate the cost burden; cities like New York City continue to exhibit affordability issues with a substantial portion of households spending more than 30% of their income on housing (45% in NYC).

3. **Income Distribution and Employment Trends**:
   - Income distribution: The state shows signs of both convergence and divergence. While the average wage has risen, there remains a substantial gap between high-skilled and low-skilled workers' incomes. This trend suggests that while overall economic growth is occurring, it is not uniformly distributed across all skill levels.
   - Employment: The employment rate in the state has remained steady, indicating robust job market performance. However, sectors like manufacturing and public services have seen a decline in employment rates over time compared to more dynamic sectors such as finance and technology.

4. **Housing Market Dynamics**:
   - Property Values & Rents: The state exhibits high correlations between property values and rents, reflecting the strong demand for housing due to urban concentration and job opportunities in key sectors. This dynamic suggests that as wages increase, so does housing costs, creating a cost-burdened population.

5. **Policy Interventions**:
   - Strengthen labor market policies: Implement measures such as expanding access to affordable healthcare and education can help attract and retain a skilled workforce in various sectors.
   - Encourage wage growth in undervalued sectors: Policies like job training programs, apprenticeships, or tax credits for businesses hiring low-skilled workers could foster better-paying jobs across different industries.

6. **National/Regional Benchmark Comparison**:
   - While the state outperforms national average in median income and wages, it still lags behind other states like California or Texas in terms of affordability and overall economic health when considering cost-of-living adjustments.

7. **Actionable Recommendations for Policymakers**:
   - Invest in education and skills training to bridge the gap between available jobs and workforce skills.
   - Encourage employment diversification, particularly in industries less affected by automation or globalization, such as agriculture and healthcare.
   - Implement targeted policies for low-income households to increase their access to affordable housing options, possibly through rent control measures or subsidies.
