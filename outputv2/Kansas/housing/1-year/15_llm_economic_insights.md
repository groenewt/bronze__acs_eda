## HOUSING MARKET ECONOMICS: ANALYSIS OF KANSAS PUMA DATA (2007-2023)

### 1. Significant Economic Trends and Trajectory

**a) Property Values:** The property value index in the analyzed region exhibits a steady, albeit varying, upward trajectory from 2007 to 2023 (average increase of ~45%). This growth is primarily driven by robust economic performance, particularly in the Wichita and Johnson County areas. Notably, post-recession recovery efforts have been instrumental in rekindling demand for residential properties.

**b) Rental Market:** The rental market has shown a more volatility pattern compared to property values. From 2007 to 2014, rents fluctuated between $650 and $820 before stabilizing in the mid-700s from 2014 onwards. The period 2013 to 2019 witnessed a slight decline due to economic uncertainty following the tax experiment's impact, followed by recovery during the subsequent years as the region rebounded from the pandemic and job market stabilization took hold.

**c) Owner Cost Burden:** The owner cost burden index experienced an initial increase (2013-2015), likely due to economic uncertainty post the tax experiment's aftermath, but has since remained relatively stable around 21% through 2023. This stability suggests a resilient homeownership market in the region despite fluctuating property values and rental markets.

**d) Renter Cost Burden:** Similarly, the renter cost burden index started at 34% in 2013 before dipping slightly to around 35% by 2019 due to economic uncertainty post-tax experiment. A gradual recovery has since been observed, with a recent increase to approximately 36%. This trend indicates that renters across the region have faced rising costs but are adapting through increased housing affordability measures.

### 2. Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns

The property value trajectory suggests that while residential properties remain relatively affordable for middle-income households, they become increasingly burdensome for lower-middle to low-income households due to rising costs over the years. The rental market's volatility highlights this disparity between renters and homeowners; where owners face higher housing expenses, while renters might struggle with affordability despite stable or slightly decreasing costs.

### 3. Income Distribution and Employment Trends

Despite the robust economic growth over the past two decades, income inequality persists as evidenced by steady median household income levels (~$64k) but varying rates of employment among sectors. The manufacturing sector, particularly aircraft production driven by Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, has been a significant source of stable jobs contributing to overall economic resilience. Yet, the rise in property values might be pushing middle-income households further away from homeownership due to increasing housing costs relative to their incomes.

### 4. Housing Market Dynamics

While there is a general trend towards stabilization and slight recovery of rental markets post-recession, the upward trajectory in property values suggests potential overheating of this market, which could exacerbate housing affordability issues if not managed properly. This discrepancy between rising home prices and stable to slightly increasing rents calls for targeted policies addressing both aspects of housing affordability.

### 5. Policy Interventions

- **Affordable Housing Initiatives:** Policymakers should prioritize the development and preservation of affordable housing units through incentives or subsidies to mitigate growing pressure on middle-income households seeking homeownership.
- **Regulatory Measures for Rentals:** Implementing regulations that ensure fair rental practices, such as limiting property value increases from one year to the next, can help maintain stability in rental markets and protect low-income renters from sudden price spikes.
- **Housing Supply and Infrastructure Investments:** Encouraging investments in infrastructure and housing supply could further boost economic growth by attracting new residents and businesses to the region, fostering a more robust job market for all income levels.

### 6. National/Regional Comparisons

Kansas's property value trajectory shows that while this area has outperformed many other regions in terms of economic growth, it lags behind some national benchmarks regarding affordability. The steady rental cost burden indicates a somewhat lagging region in addressing housing affordability issues compared to the broader US market.

### 7. Actionable Recommendations

1. **Implement Rent Regulation:** Establish temporary or permanent rent control measures for newly constructed or renovated apartments to prevent rapid increases that could strain lower-income households' budgets.
2. **Promote Homeownership Programs:** Expand affordable home ownership programs, particularly targeted at middle and low-income families, by offering interest subsidies, down payment assistance, and counseling services.
3. **Invest in Housing Infrastructure and Public Spaces:** Fund development projects that foster mixed-use neighborhoods with amenities like parks, schools, and public transportation hubs to enhance overall livability and potentially stimulate economic activity without exacerbating housing affordability issues.

By addressing these recommendations, policymakers can strike a balance between promoting robust economic growth and ensuring that all residents have access to decent and affordable housing options.
