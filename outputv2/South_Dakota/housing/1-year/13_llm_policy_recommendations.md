1. **High-Impact Research Questions:**
   - **RQ1: How do changes in housing values and rents impact income disparity over time?**
     - Key Variables to Analyze: Gross_Rent, Gross_Rent_Percentage_Income, Annual_Rent_to_Value_Ratio, Property_Tax_Rate.
     - Appropriate Methods: Regression analysis focusing on the relationship between housing metrics and household income while controlling for demographic factors such as age, sex, race/ethnicity. Expected Policy Implications: Inform policymakers about potential measures to address rising rents and their impact on economic inequality.
   
   - **RQ2: What is the relationship between agricultural diversification and employment growth across South Dakota?**
     - Key Variables to Analyze: Agricultural_Industry_Growth, Commodity_Price_Index, Tourism_Growth.
     - Appropriate Methods: Time-series analysis comparing agricultural sector changes with broader economic indicators. Expected Policy Implications: Highlight the importance of supporting diversification efforts in South Dakota's agricultural sector to sustain employment growth and resilience against market fluctuations.
   
   - **RQ3: How do evolving demographic trends (migration, birth rates) influence income mobility in urban versus rural areas of South Dakota?**
     - Key Variables to Analyze: Migration_Rates, Birth_Rates, Urbanization_Score, Rurality_Score.
     - Appropriate Methods: Multilevel modeling considering geographic variations and individual-level demographics. Expected Policy Implications: Provide data-driven insights for targeted regional development strategies addressing unique challenges in urban versus rural areas of South Dakota.

2. **Analytical Methodologies:**
   - Regression Analysis: This method will help uncover the relationship between economic variables and demographic factors, controlling for other influences. It can reveal how changes in housing values or income impacts different demographic groups' mobility and employment prospects.

3. **Longitudinal Analyses:**
   - Temporal coverage allows tracking trends over time, such as shifts in economic indicators (income growth rates), demographic patterns (aging population, changes in urbanization), or housing market dynamics (housing affordability decline).

4. **Cross-Sectional Comparisons:**
   - Comparing South Dakota to other Midwestern states can reveal how its unique geographical and socioeconomic characteristics influence economic outcomes. Additionally, comparing within a single state across different time periods helps identify trends in changing conditions.

5. **Visualizations:**
   - Line charts: To illustrate changes over time in key variables like income or housing costs.
   - Scatter plots with regression lines: For visualizing relationships between multiple variables such as the impact of population density on employment growth.
   - Heatmaps: Highlighting areas within South Dakota that showcase significant variations in demographic trends, thus informing targeted policies for those regions.

6. **Methodological Challenges and Limitations:**
   - Data quality concerns, especially regarding accurate occupancy rates or migration data, which can skew results.
   - Limited geographical detail in PUMA designation could limit the precision of certain analyses (e.g., focusing on specific counties within states).
   - Relying solely on one year's data may lead to misleading conclusions about long-term trends or seasonal fluctuations. Researchers should aim to use multiple years for robust analysis and interpretation.
