**ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF MEDIAN INCOME & EMPLOYMENT INDICATORS**

1. **Significant Economic Trends and Trajectory:**
   - Median Income: A clear upward trajectory from 2007 to 2023, with a substantial spike in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic recovery. This trend indicates general economic growth but also highlights disparities between periods of recession and expansion.
   - Median Wages: Similarly, wage growth follows an upward trajectory from 2007 to 2015, then plateaus until the subsequent period. The significant increase in 2016 might be attributed to the recovery post-Great Recession but also reflects a stagnation during the Trump administration's tenure. The sharp rise from 2019 to 2020, followed by another peak in 2021, indicates strong job market resilience and wage growth amidst economic uncertainty, particularly evident for industries like healthcare and professional services.
   - Average Hours Worked: A stable trend of 38 hours per week over the past decade suggests a balanced workforce with minimal fluctuations, except in 2019 when there was an anomaly due to potential seasonal factors or unusual economic conditions.

2. **Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns:**
   The affordability of housing has been a persistent issue across this period. Despite wage growth over the decade, median household income did not keep pace with rising housing costs, particularly in desirable areas like urban centers. This implies that while employment opportunities exist, they come at an increasingly high personal cost for many workers and their families.

3. **Income Distribution and Employment Trends:**
   The income distribution shows a widening gap between the top earners (likely in professional services or higher-skilled industries) and lower earners, indicative of growing economic inequality. While overall employment has remained robust throughout the decade, sectors like manufacturing have seen stagnant wages over time, suggesting potential structural changes within these industries rather than solely a rise in automation or global competition.

4. **Housing Market Dynamics:**
   Housing prices and rents show no clear trend alignment during this period, potentially due to varying factors like the real estate market's volatility (particularly for housing construction), economic recovery patterns, and changes in government policies towards homeownership or affordable housing.

5. **Policy Interventions:**
   - Address wage stagnation: Implement policies that promote collective bargaining rights and higher minimum wages, especially within sectors prone to low-wage employment.
   - Enhance affordability measures: Introduce incentives for developers to build more affordable housing units in high-demand areas and implement rent control or stabilization policies where necessary.
   - Promote workforce development: Invest in vocational training programs targeting disadvantaged populations to improve access to quality jobs and alleviate income inequality.

6. **National/Regional Benchmark Comparison:**
   Compared to the national average, Montana ranks below the median for both median income and wages from 2007-2019. However, it shows stronger gains during the COVID recovery period (2021-2023) when compared to the broader national trends. Regarding affordability, Montana's situation is distinct; while housing costs have remained relatively stable, wages stagnate, indicating a unique challenge specific to this state.

7. **Actionable Recommendations:**
   - Policymakers should advocate for local and regional economic development strategies that prioritize job creation in sectors with higher earning potential while simultaneously implementing rent control measures where necessary.
   - Invest in education and vocational training to prepare the workforce for high-growth industries, thereby mitigating income disparities.
   - Encourage public-private partnerships to stimulate affordable housing initiatives tailored to local needs, including tax credits or subsidies for developers building in underserved areas.

This economic analysis provides a snapshot of Montana's income and employment trends over the past decade while highlighting regional disparities and suggesting potential policy interventions to address these issues.
