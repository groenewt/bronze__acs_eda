1. Mean vs Median: For each variable, we observe a difference between mean and median values. This suggests that while the average value in the dataset (mean) is higher than the typical or central value (median), this does not necessarily imply skewness. The high means relative to medians could indicate an overrepresentation of extreme values on one end of the distribution, creating a positive skew. 

2. SKEWNESS: Skewness measures the degree and direction of asymmetry in a distribution. A skewness value greater than 1 indicates a right (positive) skew, while less than -1 implies a left (negative) skew. Values between -1 and 1 suggest a symmetrical distribution. The high positive values for all variables indicate that most data points are clustered towards the lower end of their respective ranges, with fewer extreme values on the higher side. This suggests distributions that lean slightly to the right or are positively skewed.

3. KURTOSIS: Kurtosis quantifies the "tailedness" of a distribution – specifically, whether it has heavy tails or outliers compared to a normal distribution. A kurtosis value greater than 3 indicates heavy tails (leptokurtic) while values less than 3 imply lighter-tailed distributions (platykurtic). The high positive kurtosis for all variables suggests that the data has significant "outlier" behavior, with a higher frequency of extreme values compared to what would be expected in a normal distribution.

4. VARIANCE/STD DEV: High variance or standard deviation indicates wide dispersion in the dataset, meaning there is a large spread between the mean and median values for each variable. This implies that while most data points cluster around the mean (or median), some are far from these central tendencies, indicating high variability in the data. Variables with higher standard deviations often include more extreme values or outliers.

5. Key Insights:
   - The overall dataset shows a strong positive skewness across all variables, indicating that while most income levels fall within a relatively narrow range, there are significantly higher incomes present in the dataset, often concentrated towards the upper end. This suggests an unequal distribution of wealth or high-income earners.
   - The presence of extreme values (as indicated by positive kurtosis), particularly for 'Poverty_Status', indicates a potential issue with defining poverty levels where a small number of individuals are significantly above the threshold, which may not represent true poverty status but rather exceptional circumstances or misclassification.
   - The high variance in income per hour and hours worked (income_per_hour and flag_hours_worked) indicates significant variability in these variables, with substantial differences between individuals' earnings per hour of work. This is a key factor influencing overall wealth distribution within the dataset.
