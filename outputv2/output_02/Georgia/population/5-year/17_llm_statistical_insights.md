1. Mean vs Median: The mean, calculated by adding up all values and dividing by the count of values, tends to be more sensitive to outliers or extreme values in a dataset. On the other hand, the median is unaffected by outliers because it simply arranges data from lowest to highest and finds the middle value. For instance, for income per hour (Income_Per_Hour), while the mean suggests an average of $25.20, the median indicates an hourly rate closer to $16.54. This difference could imply that, despite high earnings in some individuals' hours worked, there are still many people who work fewer hours and receive less income per hour.

2. SKEWNESS values: Skewness measures how asymmetrical a distribution is around its mean. A positive skew indicates the tail extends out to the right (more extreme values on the higher end), while a negative skew means it extends to the left (extreme values on the lower end). For instance, Income_Per_Hour shows high positively skewed characteristics due to outliers in very high hourly wages. This suggests that while there are many individuals earning substantial incomes, extreme high-income earners significantly influence the distribution of this variable.

3. KURTOSIS: Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" or "heaviness" of a distribution. A kurtosis value of 0 means a normal distribution; positive values indicate heavier tails (more extreme outliers), and negative values mean lighter tails (fewer extreme outliers). For example, Poverty_Gap indicates heavy tails in the data as it has a relatively high positively skewed kurtosis value of 0.971. This suggests that there are many individuals with significant income gaps from their poverty line, indicating considerable economic disparity.

4. VARIANCE/STD DEV: High variance or standard deviation values indicate a wide spread among the data points; in other words, there is more variability or 'spread' in the dataset compared to its mean or median. Income_Per_Week_Worked (Income_Per_Week) shows high dispersion with a variance of 3,621,797,539.86 and standard deviation of approximately 60,181. This implies that there are substantial differences in the average workweek hours across individuals, suggesting varying levels of job demands or flexibility available to them.

5. Key Insights:
   - The data distribution varies significantly by variable; some distributions show clear skewness (like Income_Per_Hour and Poverty_Gap), indicating economic disparities are not evenly distributed. 
   - Variance/STD DEV values highlight the substantial variability in many variables, such as income per week worked or poverty gap, reflecting significant differences among individuals.
   - The presence of high skewness (like Income_Per_Hour) and heavy tails (like Poverty_Gap) suggests that these distributions may not accurately represent the central tendency and dispersion for a typical individual within the population. These insights emphasize the need for more nuanced statistical measures when analyzing such data, particularly in economic studies.
