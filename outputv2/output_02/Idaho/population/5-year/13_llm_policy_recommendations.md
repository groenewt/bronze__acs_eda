1. **Research Questions and Key Variables:**
   - **RQ1: The Impact of Tech Industry Growth on Wage Disparities**
     - Key variables to analyze: Income_Per_Hour, Total_Annual_Hours, STEM_Category, Is_STEM, Has_Multiple_Disabilities.
     - Appropriate analytical methods: Regression analysis and difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to isolate the effect of tech industry growth on wage disparities between STEM and non-STEM workers. Expected policy implications include targeted workforce development programs to bridge skills gaps and promote equitable employment opportunities in the tech sector.
   - **RQ2: The Evolution of Housing Affordability Trends Over Time**
     - Key variables to analyze: Income_Per_Hour, Total_Annual_Hours, Interest_Dividend_Rental_Income, Homeownership Rate, Rent_Growth.
     - Appropriate analytical methods: Longitudinal regression and panel data analysis to examine the relationship between income growth, housing affordability trends, and homeownership rates over time. Expected policy implications involve proactive policies such as inclusionary zoning, rent control measures, or tax incentives for first-time homebuyers in high-cost areas.
   - **RQ3: The Effect of Demographic Shifts on Public Assistance Usage**
     - Key variables to analyze: Income_Per_Hour, Total_Annual_Hours, Disability_Count, Vulnerable_Uninsured, Is_Uninsured.
     - Appropriate analytical methods: Logistic regression and difference-in-differences (DiD) approach comparing pre- and post-pandemic trends of demographic groups that significantly increased public assistance usage. Expected policy implications suggest targeted social safety net expansions for vulnerable populations, particularly those affected by the pandemic's economic fallout.

2. **Longitudinal Analysis:**
   - The 15-year temporal coverage allows researchers to track trends in income, employment rates, and housing costs across different life stages and economic cycles. This longitudinal perspective aids in understanding generational wealth accumulation, the impact of shifting job markets on families' financial stability, and how demographic changes influence regional economies over time.

3. **Cross-Sectional Comparisons:**
   - Comparing states with varying industrial structures (e.g., high tech vs traditional manufacturing) could reveal the differential impacts of industry growth on wage disparities, housing affordability, and public assistance usage across regions. Additionally, comparing urban versus rural areas can highlight regional disparities in economic development and resource allocation.

4. **Visualizations:**
   - Bar charts to show changes over time in key variables such as wage growth rates or housing affordability metrics; line graphs for tracking shifts in demographic composition across different age groups, races, or genders; scatter plots illustrating the relationship between income and other socioeconomic indicators.

5. **Methodological Challenges:**
   - Data quality concerns related to self-reported information on occupation or industry sector may introduce measurement errors. Researchers should use robust statistical techniques (e.g., instrumental variables or difference-in-differences) to address potential endogeneity issues in these analyses.

6. **Limitations:**
   - The census dataset does not capture informal economic activities, potentially missing valuable information on underground labor markets and gig work dynamics. Moreover, the cross-sectional design may limit causal inferences, emphasizing the need for rigorous longitudinal studies.
