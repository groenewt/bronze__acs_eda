1. **Identifying High-Impact Research Questions:**

   a) **Question 1: How has the labor market transformed in Idaho over the past decade, particularly focusing on employment trends and sectoral shifts?**
   - Key Variables: Total_Annual_Hours, Income_Per_Hour, Flag_Employed, Occupation_Skill_Level, Skill_Level_Numeric, STEM_Category, Is_Goodsproducing

   Analytical Methods: Regression analysis comparing total hours worked and wage earnings across various industries (goods producing vs. service sector) to understand shifts in labor demand. Disaggregating by skill level can highlight the impact of technological advancements on employment opportunities.
   
   Expected Policy Implications: Insights into sectors driving growth, potential workforce development strategies for high-demand areas, and recommendations for targeted education and training programs.

   b) **Question 2: What are the trends in income distribution and poverty rates within Idaho over time?**
   - Key Variables: Median_Household_Income, Poverty_Rate, Interest_Dividend_Rental_Income

   Analytical Methods: Disaggregating data by race/ethnicity to analyze disparities in income and poverty rates. Regression analysis comparing changes over time for different demographic groups can reveal patterns of socioeconomic mobility or stagnation.
   
   Expected Policy Implications: Identification of policies that promote economic equality, targeted welfare programs addressing specific vulnerable populations, and strategies to reduce income disparities.

   c) **Question 3: How have housing characteristics evolved in Idaho from the early 2000s to the present day?**
   - Key Variables: Interest_Dividend_Rental_Income, Median_Household_Income, Population_Density, Housing_Value

   Analytical Methods: Time-series analysis comparing housing affordability metrics (median house price/median income ratio) and rental affordability indicators over time. Segmenting data by geographical areas can reveal the impact of urbanization trends on housing markets.
   
   Expected Policy Implications: Insights into effective land use policies, zoning regulations that balance growth with preservation of affordable housing options, and strategies to mitigate regional disparities in housing costs.

2. **Longitudinal Analyses:**

   - The temporal coverage enables the tracking of economic trends over time within Idaho, allowing for an examination of how employment patterns have evolved since 2007, changes in income distribution dynamics, and shifts in housing markets from the early 21st century to the present.

3. **Cross-Sectional Comparisons:**

   - Comparing Idaho's economic indicators with those of neighboring states or national benchmarks can reveal regional disparities, identify successful strategies for sustained growth, and highlight areas where policy interventions may be most effective.

4. **Specific Visualizations:**

   a) Line graphs comparing median household income trends across different industries to visualize economic shifts over time.
   
   b) Bar charts disaggregating housing affordability metrics by geographical area to highlight regional variations and policy responses.
   
   c) Interactive heat maps illustrating how population density has changed within Idaho, emphasizing the impact of urbanization trends on housing markets.

5. **Methodological Challenges/Limitations:**

   - Researchers should address potential data quality issues such as misclassification in occupation or income levels, ensuring robust and representative sample sizes for each analysis, and considering potential biases stemming from the use of proxy variables (e.g., race recode).

6. **Additional Considerations:**

   - Given the dataset's large number of variables, researchers should consider dimensionality reduction techniques to manage complexity and ensure interpretability of results.
   - Collaboration with local economic development agencies could provide valuable contextual insights and help in identifying actionable policy recommendations.
