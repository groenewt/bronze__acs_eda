**1. Research Questions & Key Variables:**

a) **Economic Inequality and Mobility**:
   - *Key variables*: Gini coefficient, income inequality measures (e.g., 90/10 ratio), median income, wealth distribution across racial categories;
   - *Analytical methods*: Regression analysis to dissect trends over time, compare economic mobility indices between different demographic groups and socioeconomic statuses;
   - *Policy implications*: Targeted welfare programs for lower-income families, policies promoting equal access to education and skills training.

b) **Housing Affordability Crisis**:
   - *Key variables*: Median home prices, housing affordability indices (e.g., Housing Opportunity Index), mortgage payment burden;
   - *Analytical methods*: Time series analysis to trace changes over time and cross-sectional comparisons across regions or urban centers;
   - *Policy implications*: Affordable housing policies, zoning reforms promoting mixed-income neighborhoods, incentivizing homeowners to rent out rooms.

c) **Economic Resilience During the COVID-19 Pandemic**:
   - *Key variables*: Unemployment rates, pandemic-related income shifts (e.g., job losses, increased gig work), changes in consumer spending patterns;
   - *Analytical methods*: Difference-in-differences analysis comparing the impact of COVID-19 on different sectors and demographic groups;
   - *Policy implications*: Tailored economic support measures (e.g., stimulus checks, unemployment benefits) for vulnerable populations;

**2. Longitudinal Analyses:**

Temporal coverage allows researchers to examine trends in income distribution, housing affordability over time, and the impact of major events like the Great Recession on state economies. For instance, tracking changes in the Gini coefficient can reveal shifts in wealth disparity. Longitudinal studies could also trace how specific policy interventions (e.g., minimum wage increases) have affected income distribution over decades.

**3. Cross-sectional Comparisons:**

Comparing Hawaii with peer states such as California, New York, and Texas on variables like median home prices, unemployment rates, or educational attainment can reveal relative strengths and weaknesses in state economic performance. For instance, comparing Hawaii's housing affordability crisis with that of other island nations could offer insights into geographic factors influencing real estate costs.

**4. Visualizations:**

- **Income Inequality Heat Maps**: To illustrate regional disparities in income distribution, this visualization would use different colors to depict the Gini coefficient or similar measures across various regions.
- **Housing Affordability Time Series Graphs**: These graphs could visually demonstrate changes in median home prices and housing affordability indices over time for Hawaii compared with its peer states.
- **Economic Mobility Over Decades**: This line graph would track economic mobility measures, such as the 90/10 ratio or income elasticity of labor supply, across different decades in Hawaii and against national averages to highlight trends in intergenerational income mobility.

**5. Methodological Challenges:**

- **Data Quality**: The ACS dataset's sample size might pose challenges for detecting small but significant differences or identifying outliers, requiring robust statistical methods and sensitivity analyses.
- **Variable Measurement Error**: Misclassification of race categories (e.g., from two to three categories) could lead to biased results; researchers should use appropriate imputation techniques if necessary.
- **Temporal Resolution**: The 16-year dataset might not capture short-term fluctuations, making it crucial for researchers to employ time series analysis methods that can account for such variations.
