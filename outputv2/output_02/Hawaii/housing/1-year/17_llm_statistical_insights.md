1. Differences between MEAN and MEDIAN: The mean (average) value of a dataset is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the count of values. On the other hand, the median is the middle value when a dataset is ordered from least to greatest. For variables where the distribution appears symmetric or bell-shaped around the center line (mean), like 'Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost' or 'Structure_Age', there's minimal difference between mean and median, suggesting that these distributions are not skewed. However, for data sets such as 'Flag_First_Mortgage_Payment' or 'Flag_Property_Value', the distribution is heavily skewed to the right (positive skewness), meaning they have a longer tail extending towards higher values. This implies that there are more extreme high values than low ones in these variables.

2. SKEWNESS Values: A skewness value of 0 indicates a perfectly symmetric distribution, while values greater or less than zero indicate positive and negative skew respectively. In our data set, the majority of distributions (like 'Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost', 'Structure_Age') are slightly positively skewed, indicating that they have more extreme highs rather than lows compared to their mean. This suggests a distribution with an asymmetrical tail extending towards higher values and fewer low-value observations.

3. KURTOSIS Interpretation: Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution - how heavy or light are its tails in relation to a normal distribution. A positive kurtosis indicates heavy tails (outliers) while negative kurtosis means lighter-tailed distributions with fewer outliers. In our dataset, 'Flag_First_Mortgage_Payment' and 'Flag_Property_Value' show high positive kurtosis values of 21.217 and 36.002 respectively. This suggests that these variables have significantly more extreme values (outliers) compared to normal distributions with less than one standard deviation from the mean.

4. Key Insights:
   - The presence of a high proportion of skewed data, particularly in 'Flag_First_Mortgage_Payment' and 'Flag_Property_Value', suggests that these might have significant outliers or deviations from typical patterns. This could be due to unique events like early mortgage defaults or sudden property value increases/decreases.
   - The high variability (dispersion) seen in variables such as 'Structure_Age' and 'Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost' is evident with their large variance and standard deviation values, indicating that a larger range of values exists around the mean for these datasets compared to others. This could suggest fluctuations or changes over time in structure age or utility costs.
   - The relatively high average (mean) value across most variables might indicate an overall central tendency towards higher incomes and property values when considering the entire dataset, which is consistent with many developed countries' economic trends.

5. Overall Data Characteristics and Quality: Despite some skewed distributions indicating potential outliers or unique data points, the majority of the datasets (like 'Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost', 'Structure_Age') show relatively symmetric patterns around their means. The high dispersion in variables like 'Flag_First_Mortgage_Payment' and 'Flag_Property_Value' suggests that these datasets contain more extreme values compared to typical scenarios, indicating a need for careful analysis when interpreting these specific categories. Overall, the quality of data appears to be good with clear distributions and substantial variability across most variables. However, the presence of skewed distributions in certain areas requires special attention during data interpretation or modeling processes.
