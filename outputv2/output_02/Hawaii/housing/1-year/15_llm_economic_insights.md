## HOUSING MARKET INDICATORS: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF HAWAII'S REAL ESTATE SECTOR

### Trends and Trajectory

1. **Property Values**: The most striking trend observed in the property values data is a steady upward trajectory from 2007 to 2023, with significant jumps between specific years (e.g., $499,000 in 2012 versus $650,000 in 2019). This trend is driven by strong demand for housing due to Hawaii's popularity as a tourist destination and the state's robust economy post-recession. The rapid increase in property values indicates that housing has become increasingly expensive relative to income, with the median household income barely budging during this period.

2. **Rental Market**: A similar pattern emerges from the rental market data, where occupancy rates fluctuate but remain relatively high (ranging between 1400 and 1850 units) over the study period. The steady increase in property values has not directly translated into corresponding increases in rental prices, suggesting that landlords are managing to maintain reasonable rental costs despite rising housing expenses. This trend supports Hawaii's reputation as a destination for retirees seeking affordable long-term living options.

3. **Owner Cost Burden and Renter Cost Burden**: Both metrics show steady increases from 2007 to 2023, with no clear downward trend observed. The owner cost burden peaked in 2019 at 26% before declining slightly to 25% by 2023, while the renter cost burden also peaked at 41% in 2019 and has remained relatively stable since then (peaking again briefly during the COVID-19 pandemic). This indicates that homeowners are shouldering a disproportionately high financial strain compared to renters, which is partly due to Hawaii's limited supply of affordable housing options.

### Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns

The data reveals that while both owner cost burden (25% in 2023) and rental cost burden (42%) remain high, the latter disproportionately affects lower-income renters. As property values continue to rise, they put a heavier financial strain on tenants whose incomes often fall below those of homeowners. This situation underscores the need for Hawaii's housing policies to focus more on creating affordable housing options and implementing rent control measures.

### Income Distribution and Employment Trends

The data does not directly provide insights into income distribution trends, but it suggests that the growing demand for housing is not being met with corresponding job creation or wage growth in Hawaii's economy. This imbalance could contribute to rising cost burdens as more people compete for a limited number of housing units and services. Employment trends show signs of improvement, but disparities remain between different sectors (e.g., tourism versus tech).

### Housing Market Dynamics

The steady increase in property values and rental occupancy rates indicate that the Hawaiian real estate market is not experiencing a glut or shortage of housing, but rather one where prices are reflecting strong demand without corresponding supply growth. This dynamic has led to both landlords maintaining reasonable rental costs and homeowners bearing significant financial burdens due to rising property values.

### Policy Interventions

Based on these trends, the following policy interventions could help mitigate affordability issues:
1. **Increase Affordable Housing Supply**: Implement policies that incentivize private developers to create more affordable housing units, such as density bonuses or tax credits.
2. **Rent Control Measures**: Introduce rent control legislation where necessary to limit annual increases and protect renters from excessive cost burdens.
3. **Promote Job Creation in Hospitality Industry**: Policies aimed at fostering economic growth in the tourism sector could lead to job creation, wage growth, and increased demand for housing without necessarily inflating prices further.

### National/Regional Comparison

When compared nationally or regionally, Hawaii's real estate trends show a state that is outperforming national averages in terms of property values but lagging behind in rent affordability and income distribution. This discrepancy highlights the need for tailored local policies addressing unique challenges faced by Hawaiian residents.

### Actionable Recommendations for Policymakers

1. **Review Zoning Laws**: Streamline zoning regulations to allow for more efficient use of land and potentially increase housing supply.
2. **Encourage Diversification in the Economy**: Implement policies that promote job growth outside of tourism, such as investment in technology, film production, or renewable energy sectors.
3. **Implement Inclusive Growth Strategies**: Develop comprehensive strategies to ensure equitable economic development across all demographic groups and geographical areas within Hawaii.

In conclusion, while property values continue to rise steadily in Hawaii's real estate sector, the rising owner cost burden and rental occupancy costs present significant affordability challenges for lower-income residents. Policymakers must address these issues through tailored interventions focusing on increased housing supply, rent control measures, and job creation strategies to ensure long-term economic stability and quality of life for all Hawaiian citizens.
