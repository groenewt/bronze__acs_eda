1. **MEAN vs MEDIAN**: The mean (average) is a robust measure of central tendency, while the median provides an indication of where half the observations lie above or below it. For instance, in 'Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost', the mean is 223.50 and the median is also 223.50, indicating that these two measures are very close to each other. However, for variables like 'First_Mortgage_Payment' or 'Gross_Rent', which often include zeroes (indicating payments or rents), the mean can be skewed towards lower values due to the presence of negative numbers. Here, the median is more representative as it avoids being influenced by these extreme low values.

2. **SKEWNESS**: SKEWNESS measures the degree of asymmetry around the mean in a distribution. A positive value indicates a right-skewed (tailed heavily on the right) distribution, while a negative value suggests left-skewness (heavy tails to the left). Values close to zero indicate symmetrical distributions. For example, 'First_Mortgage_Payment' and 'Gross_Rent' have positive skewnesses indicating they are more likely to be higher than lower due to the presence of non-zero values. On the other hand, 'Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost', with a negative skewness, suggests it is less likely to be extremely high or low compared to its mean, but still has a noticeable spread around the median.

3. **KURTOSIS**: KURTOSIS indicates whether a distribution has heavy tails (peaks) or light tails. Positive kurtosis implies heavier peaks and shoulders than a normal distribution; negative kurtosis suggests lighter peaks, with more frequency of extreme values compared to a normal distribution. For example, 'First_Mortgage_Payment' and 'Gross_Rent', both having positive skewness, suggest that these variables have heavily influenced by outliers or extreme values (high payments or rents). The heavy tails indicate the presence of such anomalies in their distributions.

4. **Variance/STD DEV**: Variance measures how spread out the data is from its mean. A high variance implies a large dispersion, while low variance indicates that most data points are close to the mean. In this dataset, 'Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost', 'Property_Tax_Rate' and 'Structure_Age' show high dispersion due to their relatively small variances (close to 1), suggesting that these variables have a wide range of values in relation to their means.

5. **Key Insights**:
   - The dataset shows skewness across many variables, indicating that the data may not be perfectly symmetric around their mean. This could suggest uneven distribution towards higher or lower values, influenced by outliers or specific categories (like zero for 'First_Mortgage_Payment' and 'Gross_Rent').
   - Kurtosis is positive across most variables, suggesting that the tails of these distributions are heavier than those of a normal distribution. This implies there might be an increased likelihood of extreme values in these categories.
   - High variance or dispersion (as indicated by low standard deviation) reveals substantial differences between individual observations and their mean. For instance, 'Total_Monthly_Utility_Cost' has high variability, implying a wide range of utility costs across individuals. This could be attributed to varying usage patterns, income levels, or local cost variations in different regions.

The quality of data can also be inferred from these insights: while the dataset covers various aspects (like income, utilities, mortgage payments), it's skewed and has outliers, indicating that careful handling is needed for accurate analysis and interpretation.
