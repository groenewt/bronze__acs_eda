1. **Research Questions:**

   a) *Economic Growth and Inequality:*
      - Key Variables: GDP_Change, Median_Household_Income, Poverty_Rate, Gini_Coefficient, SNAP_Takeup_Gap
      - Analytical Methods: Time Series Analysis, Regression Models (with interaction terms to examine changes over time)
      - Policy Implications: Examine the impact of economic policies on income inequality and poverty rates. Identify interventions that might mitigate growing disparities.

   b) *Housing Affordability and Stagnation:*
      - Key Variables: Annual_Rent_to_Value_Ratio, Median_Household_Income, Poverty_Rate, Housing_Affordability_Index, Rent_Costs_as_Percentage_of_Median_Income
      - Analytical Methods: Spatial Analysis, Panel Data Techniques (for cross-sectional comparisons)
      - Policy Implications: Investigate the effectiveness of housing policies aimed at improving affordability. Identify strategies to address stagnant rents and home values relative to income growth.

   c) *Demographic Shifts and Workforce Development:*
      - Key Variables: Working_Age_Persons, School-Aged_Children, Foreign_Born_Population_Percentage, Education_Attainment, Employment_Status, Labor_Force_Participation_Rate
      - Analytical Methods: Time Series Analysis, Regression Models (with interaction terms to examine changes over time)
      - Policy Implications: Examine the relationship between demographic trends and workforce development. Identify policies that can support a skilled labor force responsive to emerging industries.

2. **Analytical Methods:**
   For each research question, we would employ a combination of quantitative methods such as time series analysis for economic growth and affordability indicators, panel data techniques for cross-sectional comparisons, and regression models for examining relationships between variables over time. These methods will allow us to discern trends, correlations, and causal effects within the dataset.

3. **Longitudinal Analyses:**
   The 15-year temporal coverage enables a comprehensive view of economic growth, housing affordability changes, and demographic shifts over time. Longitudinal analyses will help us understand how these factors have interacted with each other and the broader socioeconomic context to shape Idaho's development.

4. **Cross-Sectional Comparisons:**
   By comparing across years, we can examine changes in housing affordability over time, track demographic shifts (like population growth or aging), and assess economic diversification trends. These comparisons will provide context for the observed longitudinal patterns and inform policy decisions based on current conditions.

5. **Visualizations:**
   a) Line charts to illustrate changes in key economic indicators over time, highlighting shifts in income distribution or housing affordability.
   b) Scatter plots connecting education attainment with employment status and poverty rates could help understand the interplay between human capital formation and labor market outcomes.
   c) Heatmaps showing regional differences in demographic trends (like population growth, foreign-born percentage) can emphasize areas requiring targeted policy support.

6. **Methodological Challenges & Limitations:**
   - Data quality might be a concern due to potential sampling biases or missing values at the PUMA level. Researchers should employ robust data imputation techniques and sensitivity analyses to address these challenges.
   - The dataset's scope, though comprehensive in terms of variables, may lack granularity that would require more detailed information from other sources (e.g., census tract-level data for finer demographic analysis).
   - Researchers must be mindful of potential endogeneity issues when examining the relationship between economic growth and policy interventions aimed at reducing inequality or improving housing affordability.
