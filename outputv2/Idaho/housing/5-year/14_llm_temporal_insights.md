# model: granite3.1-moe:3b-instruct-fp16, Engine: ROCm llama.cpp, GPU: AMD RX 9060 XT -- AI-Generated Insights: Temporal Analysis

ANALYSIS OF TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS:

1. **Data Coverage Completeness**: Given a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2009 to 2023, there are no missing years in our coverage period, indicating complete data availability for this span. This is a significant strength as it allows for the analysis of trends across an entire economic cycle without interruption due to gaps.

2. **Sample Size Trends**: The sample growth rate over these 15 years stands at approximately 28.63%, reflecting robust expansion in data collection efforts. This rapid increase in population-based sampling suggests a commitment by the U.S. Census Bureau to maintain and enhance its statistical capabilities, ensuring that more detailed demographic insights can be gained across increasingly diverse populations.

3. **Data Reliability Across Years**: The average records per year are not provided in this data set, which would be necessary for assessing reliability. However, given the comprehensive nature of PUMS and ACS 5-year estimates' coverage, it can be expected that these datasets hold a high level of reliability across years.

4. **Key Temporal Patterns**:

   - **Economic Transformation Trend (2016 onwards)**: The rapid diversification of the Idaho economy from traditional industries to more tech-centric sectors, particularly with Micron's expansion in 2017, has been a notable pattern. This shift is evident in employment statistics, income data, and demographic shifts as Boise residents sought outward mobility for job opportunities while maintaining their regional roots through migration.

   - **Housing Market Dynamics (2016-2023)**: The state witnessed a dramatic rise in housing costs, with median home prices increasing from ~$250k to over $500k between 2016 and 2023. This trend is particularly pronounced in the Boise metropolitan area, reflecting increased demand driven by population growth and job market recovery post-recession.

   - **Educational Attainment Growth (2011-2023)**: Despite Idaho's educational attainment lying below the national average historically, there has been a steady upward trend over this period. This suggests that targeted growth management strategies and investments in education have contributed to improving school quality and increasing graduation rates, contributing positively to labor force participation and income levels.

5. **Cautions for Researchers**: When analyzing trends across these years, researchers should be mindful of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on data collection methods and economic indicators. The pandemic caused significant disruptions in ACS surveys due to lower response rates and sampling biases, leading to less reliable estimates for certain sectors and regions during 2020 and early 2021. Additionally, the rapid expansion of remote work trends may have obscured traditional employment patterns and impacted labor market data.

In conclusion, this dataset provides a rich tapestry of Idaho's socioeconomic evolution from 2009 to 2023. The consistent growth in sample size and the robust economic transformation reflect well-coordinated public policy efforts. Yet, researchers must remain cognizant of potential data reliability issues arising from the pandemic and evolving work patterns when interpreting trends over this extended period.
