# American Community Survey (ACS) - Overview & Guide
## GENERATED BY CLAUDE 4.5 Sonnet

## What is the American Community Survey?

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing statistical survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides vital information on an annual basis about the nation and its people. Unlike the Decennial Census which occurs every 10 years, the ACS provides updated demographic, social, economic, and housing data every year.

## Data Types in This Repository

### PUMS (Public Use Microdata Sample)
This repository focuses on **PUMS data**, which provides individual-level records (anonymized and privacy-protected) rather than aggregated statistics. PUMS allows for custom tabulations and detailed cross-tabulations not available in pre-aggregated tables.

### Survey Types
- **Population (p)**: Individual-level demographic, social, and economic characteristics
- **Housing (h)**: Housing unit characteristics, costs, and conditions

### Survey Scopes

#### 1-Year Estimates
- **Coverage**: Areas with populations of 65,000+
- **Sample Size**: Smaller (~2-3% of population)
- **Timeliness**: Most current data
- **Reliability**: Less precise, larger margins of error
- **Best For**: Large geographic areas, tracking year-to-year changes

#### 5-Year Estimates
- **Coverage**: All geographic areas, including small communities
- **Sample Size**: Larger (~10-15% of population over 5 years)
- **Timeliness**: Data averaged over 5-year period
- **Reliability**: More precise, smaller margins of error
- **Best For**: Small geographic areas, small populations, detailed analysis

## Understanding the Data

### Time Period Coverage
- This repository includes data from **2007-2023**
- ACS officially began in 2005, with full implementation in 2006
- Data collection methodology has evolved over time

### Geographic Coverage
All 50 states, District of Columbia, and territories:
- Puerto Rico (PR)
- American Samoa (AS)
- Guam (GU)
- Northern Mariana Islands (MP)
- U.S. Virgin Islands (VI - not in current script)

### Key Variables Available
PUMS data includes hundreds of variables across categories:
- **Demographics**: Age, sex, race, ethnicity, citizenship
- **Social**: Education, marital status, fertility, veteran status
- **Economic**: Employment, income, occupation, industry, commuting
- **Housing**: Tenure, value, costs, structure type, utilities

## Important Considerations

### Data Limitations
1. **Sampling Error**: ACS is based on a sample, not a complete count
2. **Non-Sampling Error**: Possible coverage errors, non-response bias, measurement error
3. **Top/Bottom Coding**: Extreme values may be top-coded or bottom-coded for privacy
4. **Methodology Changes**: Survey methods have evolved, affecting comparability across years
5. **Missing Data**: Some variables may have high non-response rates

### Privacy & Confidentiality
- Census Bureau employs disclosure avoidance techniques
- Geographic detail limited to Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) of 100,000+ people
- Some variables may be suppressed or aggregated for privacy protection
- **Never attempt to re-identify individuals** in the data

### Weighting
- PUMS records include person and housing unit weights
- **Always use weights** for population-level estimates
- Weights account for sampling design, non-response, and post-stratification

## Ethical Use Guidelines

### When Using Census Data
✅ **DO:**
- Use official Census Bureau documentation for variable definitions
- Apply appropriate weights for population estimates
- Report margins of error for estimates
- Respect Census Bureau Terms of Service
- Implement rate limiting when accessing Census servers
- Cache data locally to minimize server requests
- Cite data sources properly

❌ **DON'T:**
- Attempt to re-identify individuals or households
- Overwhelm Census servers with excessive requests
- Misrepresent data or findings
- Ignore sampling errors and limitations
- Use data without understanding methodology

## Data Quality & Accuracy

### Understanding Margins of Error
- All ACS estimates have margins of error due to sampling
- Use replicate weights or design factors for variance estimation
- Smaller populations and rare characteristics have larger margins of error

### Comparability Over Time
- **2020 Data**: Affected by COVID-19 pandemic response modifications
- **Pre-2010**: Some methodological differences
- Always consult technical documentation for comparability notes

## Advanced Topics

### Replicate Weights
- PUMS includes 80 replicate weights for variance estimation
- Required for accurate standard error calculations
- Implement Successive Difference Replication (SDR) method

### Geographic Identifiers
- **State**: FIPS codes
- **PUMA**: Public Use Microdata Areas
- **COUNTY**: Available for some states via PUMA-to-county crosswalks

### Recoding & Grouping
- Census Bureau provides example code for common recodes
- Document any custom recodes or derived variables
- Maintain reproducibility in analysis pipelines

## Version Control & Updates

### Data Updates
- 1-Year data: Released annually in fall
- 5-Year data: Released annually in December
- Check Census website for errata and updates

### Documentation Changes
- Variables may be added, removed, or modified
- Code lists and categories can change between years
- Always use year-specific data dictionaries
