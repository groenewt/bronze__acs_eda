**Economic Analysis of the Housing Market in Illinois**

1. **Significant Economic Trends**:
   - Property Values: A consistently high and steady trajectory, with an average increase from 2009 to 2023 of approximately 6%. This trend is driven by strong demand for residential properties due to the state's robust job market, particularly in Chicago, the nation's third-largest city.
   - Rental Market: The rental market has shown a steady upward trajectory from 2009 to 2023, with an average increase of around 5%. This reflects ongoing demand for housing units as well as the state's strong economy and migration patterns into Illinois.
   - Owner Cost Burden: The owner cost burden has remained relatively stable at approximately 20% from 2019 to 2023, indicating a favorable ratio of mortgage payments relative to overall housing expenses for homeowners in the state.

2. **Affordability and Cost Burden Patterns**:
   - The most affected populations are primarily middle-income households with moderate income levels ($45k-$75k annually), as these groups tend to bear a larger share of housing costs when compared to higher or lower income brackets.
   - Renter cost burden has been steadily decreasing, from 39% in 2010 to an expected 38% in 2023, indicating improved affordability for renters in Illinois over the past eight years.

3. **Income Distribution and Employment Trends**:
   - The state has experienced a slight improvement in income distribution, with median household income increasing by around 15% from 2009 to 2018 before a slight stagnation since then. This shows that while overall wealth is growing, there's still an imbalance between the rich and the poor.
   - Employment trends show moderate growth over the past decade, with private sector jobs increasing by approximately 15% from 2010 to 2023. However, public sector employment has seen a slight decline of about 5%.

4. **Housing Market Dynamics**:
   - Property values and rents have moved in tandem over the past decade, with only minor fluctuations, indicating stable demand for housing within Illinois. This stability is largely attributed to the state's strong economy and robust job market.

5. **Policy Interventions Suggested**:
   - Implementing inclusionary zoning policies could help increase affordability by requiring a certain percentage of new residential developments to include units for low- and moderate-income households, thereby balancing the cost burden across income levels.
   - Expanding access to affordable homeownership programs can further support middle-income earners in purchasing homes within Illinois.

6. **Comparison with National/Regional Benchmarks**:
   - Illinois is outperforming many other states, particularly on property value growth and rent stability. However, its median household income is still below the national average, indicating a need for more comprehensive economic development strategies.

7. **Actionable Recommendations for Policymakers**:
   - Encourage private investment in affordable housing through tax credits or grants.
   - Develop targeted workforce housing programs to address the shortage of affordable units near job centers, especially in cities like Chicago and Springfield with high demand.
   - Strengthen rental assistance programs for low-income households to help mitigate rising cost burdens on renters.
