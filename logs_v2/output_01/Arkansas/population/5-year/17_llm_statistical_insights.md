1. **MEAN vs MEDIAN for each variable:** The mean, calculated by averaging all values in a dataset, tends to be influenced more heavily by extreme values (outliers), while the median, which is the middle value after sorting the data, is less affected. For instance, the mean of Total Annual Hours shows high dispersion and skewness towards higher values compared to its median. This suggests that while most individuals work a significant amount of hours annually, there are few who work substantially more than others.

2. **SKEWNESS values:** Skewness measures the degree of asymmetry in the distribution around its mean. High positive or negative skewness indicates a distribution with an outsized number of extreme values on one side compared to the other, suggesting that distributions are not symmetrical. In our data set, many variables show high skepticism (greater than 0), indicating skewed distributions where there's a preponderance of lower or higher values relative to the mean. This implies that while most individuals fall within certain ranges, some deviate significantly from these averages.

3. **KURTOSIS - Heavy tails and outliers:** Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of a distribution – whether it has heavier tails (more extreme values) or lighter tails compared to a normal distribution. High kurtosis indicates distributions with heavy tails, meaning there are more extreme values than would be expected from a normal distribution. For instance, Poverty Gap and Income Per Hour both show high kurtosis, suggesting that these variables have substantial outliers or heavier-tailed distributions compared to what's typically seen in normal data sets.

4. **VARIANCE/STD DEV - Dispersion:** The variance measures the average of the squared differences from the Mean, while standard deviation is just the square root of variance. High variances and standard deviations indicate that values are spread out over a wide range from the mean, suggesting high dispersion in the data set. Variables with this characteristic include Income Per Hour, Total Annual Hours, Flag_Wage_Income, and Flag_Hours_Worked - these variables show significant variability around their respective means.

3. **Key Insights:**
    a. The presence of skewness suggests that while most individuals fall within certain ranges or averages (like income levels), there are substantial deviations from these norms which may indicate disparities, inequalities, or anomalous cases - particularly noticeable in variables such as Total Annual Hours and Flag_Wage_Income.
    b. High kurtosis reveals that our data has heavy-tailed distributions, indicating the presence of outliers or extreme values more frequently than what would be expected from a normal distribution. This could imply unusual occurrences leading to larger disparities in wealth or employment patterns compared to average incomes and wage levels.
    c. The high variance/standard deviation across several variables suggests that there is significant variability among the dataset, indicating wide range of potential outcomes within these categories (like annual hours worked or income). This could imply considerable disparities in workforce size, earning capacities, etc., compared to typical averages.
