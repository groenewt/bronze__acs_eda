1. The difference between Mean (average) and Median for each variable suggests that while mean is a measure of central tendency focusing on the typical value, median gives an indication of where most values lie in relation to other values. In skewed distributions (where one side has significantly more observations than the other), the mean may not reflect the actual center as closely as the median due to outliers or extreme values pulling it towards one end. For instance, in variables like First Mortgage Payment and Property Taxes, where there are often large, infrequent payments, the median would likely be a better representation of typical payment amounts because extreme highs (outliers) do not significantly affect this value.

2. The skewness values indicate that these distributions are asymmetric or non-normal. In other words, they're not symmetrical around their mean/median. High positive skewness suggests a long tail extending to the right side of the distribution—meaning there are more extreme highs than low values. This could suggest an imbalance in data points, possibly due to outliers or one-sided trends. For example, First Mortgage Payment has a significant portion of very large, higher payments (indicated by positive skewness), suggesting that some individuals might have substantial mortgages but relatively few high-value payments.

3. The Kurtosis value provides insight into the "tailedness" or outliers in the distribution. A kurtosis greater than 3 indicates a distribution with heavier tails (more extreme values) compared to a normal distribution, while less than 3 suggests lighter tails. Kurtosis of -1 for Income to FPL Ratio implies that this data set doesn't deviate significantly from the normal distribution's tail behavior; hence it has mildly heavy tails. 

4. The high dispersion in variables such as First Mortgage Payment, Property Taxes, and Working Age Persons' Income can be attributed to their skewness and kurtosis values indicating heavier-tailed distributions. These variables often have a larger range of possible outcomes or extreme values than normal distributions, leading to high variance (standard deviation squared) and dispersion in the data set.

5. Three key insights about overall data characteristics and quality:

   a) The presence of skewness across several variables suggests that these datasets might be influenced by outliers or one-sided trends. This warrants further investigation, possibly through techniques such as box plots, histograms with notches for comparing distributions visually, and robust statistical measures like the median and interquartile range (IQR) instead of mean and standard deviation.

   b) High Kurtosis in income distribution variables indicates that these datasets are more susceptible to extreme values or outliers compared to normal distributions. This could imply an imbalance in wealth or financial conditions, warranting a deeper exploration into economic factors contributing to these disparities.

   c) The presence of non-zero variances (and therefore standard deviations) for all variables suggests that there is significant variability among the data points, which is important for understanding how closely different observations cluster around their mean values or medians. However, high variance in some cases might indicate potential challenges in predicting these variables using simple linear regression models, as extreme outliers can significantly impact results.
