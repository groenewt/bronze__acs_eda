Evaluation from Claude: 
Key Insights
	What the AI Model Did Well:
		Processed real Census PUMA microdata correctly
		Generated valid statistical summaries
		Identified trends from individual-level observations
		(Arizona) Connected data patterns to documented economic events
	What the AI Model Failed At:
		Never explained it was using PUMA microdata - critical documentation gap
		(Arkansas) Confused nominal vs. real growth - serious interpretive error
		(California) Didn't specify geographic scope despite PUMA being location-specific
		No comparison to published Census aggregate statistics to validate findings
	Recommendation for Future AI-Generated Analysis:
		Every PUMA-based analysis should include a methodology note like:
"This analysis is based on U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) for [specific PUMA codes]. Statistics 			represent individual-level observations and may differ from published household-level aggregates. All dollar figures are in [nominal/inflation-adjusted] 	terms."

Bottom Line: The AI had good data but poor documentation. Arkansas analysis additionally had flawed interpretation (nominal/real confusion). Arizona analysis was best because data patterns aligned with verifiable external events.
